                              Thirteen Techniques for Truth Suppression
                              by David Martin, the following may be
                              useful to the initiate in the world of
                              dealing with veiled and half-truth, lies,
                              and suppression of truth when serious
                              crimes are studied in public forums. This,
                              sadly, includes every day news media, one
                              of the worst offenders with respect to
                              being a source of disinformation. Where
                              the crime involves a conspiracy, or a
                              conspiracy to cover up the crime, there
                              will invariably be a disinformation
                              campaign launched against those seeking to
                              uncover and expose the truth and/or the
                              conspiracy. There are specific tactics
                              which disinfo artists tend to apply, as
                              revealed here. Also included with this
                              material are seven common traits of the
                              disinfo artist which may also prove useful
                              in identifying players and motives. The
                              more a particular party fits the traits
                              and is guilty of following the rules, the
                              more likely they are a professional
                              disinfo artist with a vested motive.
                              People can be bought, threatened, or
                              blackmailed into providing disinformation,
                              so even "good guys" can be suspect in many
                              cases.</span></big><br style="font-weight:

                              rational person participating as one
                              interested in the truth will evaluate that
                              chain of evidence and conclude either that
                              the links are solid and conclusive, that
                              one or more links are weak and need
                              further development before conclusion can
                              be arrived at, or that one or more links
                              can be broken, usually invalidating (but
                              not necessarily so, if parallel links
                              already exist or can be found, or if a
                              particular link was merely supportive, but
                              not in itself key) the argument. The game
                              is played by raising issues which either
                              strengthen or weaken (preferably to the
                              point of breaking) these links. It is the
                              job of a disinfo artist to interfere with
                              these evaluation... to at least make
                              people think the links are weak or broken
                              when, in truth, they are not... or to
                              propose alternative solutions leading away
                              from the truth. Often, by simply impeding
                              and slowing down the process through
                              disinformation tactics, a level of victory
                              is assured because apathy increases with

                              found... but truth still wins out. There
                              is no shame in being the creator or
                              supporter of a failed solution, chain, or
                              link, if done with honesty in search of
                              the truth. This is the rational approach.
                              While it is understandable that a person
                              can become emotionally involved with a
                              particular side of a given issue, it is
                              really unimportant who wins, as long as
                              truth wins. But the disinfo artist will
                              seek to emotionalize and chastise any
                              failure (real or false claims thereof),
                              and will seek by means of intimidation to
                              prevent discussion in general.</span></big><br

                              would hang them. Since fact and truth
                              seldom fall on their own, they must be
                              overcome with lies and deceit. Those who
                              are professional in the art of lies and
                              deceit, such as the intelligence community
                              and the professional criminal (often the
                              same people or at least working together),
                              tend to apply fairly well defined and
                              observable tools in this process. However,
                              the public at large is not well armed
                              against such weapons, and is often easily
                              led astray by these time-proven tactics.
                              Remarkably, not even media and law
                              enforcement have NOT BEEN TRAINED to deal
                              with these issues. For the most part, only
                              the players themselves understand the
                              rules of the game.</span></big><br

                              in to orchestrate the media response to
                              Waco on behalf of Janet Reno. Mark

                              evidence which cannot be broken by truth,
                              but at all times, to use clever deceptions
                              or lies to make select links seem weaker
                              than they are, create the illusion of a
                              break, or better still, cause any who are
                              considering the chain to be distracted in
                              any number of ways, including the method
                              of questioning the credentials of the
                              presenter. Please understand that fact is
                              fact, regardless of the source. Likewise,

                              This is why criminals are allowed to
                              testify against other criminals. Where a

                              lie renders it completely invalid. Were a
                              known 'liar's' testimony to stand on its
                              own without supporting fact, it might
                              certainly be of questionable value, but if
                              the testimony (argument) is based on
                              verifiable or otherwise demonstrable
                              facts, it matters not who does the
                              presenting or what their motives are, or

                              particularly with respects to public
                              forums such as newspaper letters to the
                              editor, and Internet chat and news groups,
                              the disinfo type has a very important
                              role. In these forums, the principle
                              topics of discussion are generally
                              attempts by individuals to cause other
                              persons to become interested in their own
                              particular position, idea, or solution --
                              very much in development at the time.
                              People often use such mediums as a
                              sounding board and in hopes of pollination
                              to better form their ideas. Where such
                              ideas are critical of government or
                              powerful, vested groups (especially if
                              their criminality is the topic), the
                              disinfo artist has yet another role -- the
                              role of nipping it in the bud. They also
                              seek to stage the concept, the presenter,
                              and any supporters as less than credible
                              should any possible future confrontation
                              in more public forums result due to their
                              early successes. You can often spot the
                              disinfo types at work here by the unique
                              application of "higher standards" of
                              discussion than necessarily warranted.
                              They will demand that those presenting
                              arguments or concepts back everything up
                              with the same level of expertise as a
                              professor, researcher, or investigative
                              writer. Anything less renders any
                              discussion meaningless and unworthy in
                              their opinion, and anyone who disagrees is
                              obviously stupid -- and they generally put
                              it in exactly those terms.</span></big><br

                              argument is being applied and when

                              tool. Accuse those guilty of the later
                              freely. They (both those deliberately
                              seeking to lead you astray, and those who
                              are simply foolish or misguided thinkers)
                              generally run for cover when thus
                              illuminated, or -- put in other terms,
                              they put up or shut up (a perfectly
                              acceptable outcome either way, since truth
                              is the goal.) Here are the twenty-five
                              methods and seven traits, some of which
                              don't apply directly to NG application.
                              Each contains a simple example in the form
                              of actual (some paraphrased for
                              simplicity) from NG comments on commonly
                              known historical events, and a proper
                              response. Accusations should not be
                              overused -- reserve for repeat offenders
                              and those who use multiple tactics.
                              Responses should avoid falling into
                              emotional traps or informational
                              sidetracks, unless it is feared that some
                              observers will be easily dissuaded by the
                              trickery. Consider quoting the complete
                              rule rather than simply citing it, as
                              others will not have reference. Offer to

                              disinformation tactics. The Internet
                              charge reported widely is based on a
                              single FBI interview statement to media
                              and a similar statement by a Congressman,
                              neither of which had actually seen
                              Pierre's document. As the FBI is being
                              accused in participating in a cover up of
                              this matter and Pierre claims his material
                              is not Internet sourced, it is natural
                              that FBI would have reason to paint his
                              material in a negative light. For you to
                              assume the FBI to have no bias in the face

                              found on Internet is worthless is not
                              founded. At best you may say it must be

                            They never actually discuss issues head-on
                            or provide constructive input, generally
                            avoiding citation of references or
                            credentials. Rather, they merely imply this,
                            that, and the other. Virtually everything
                            about their presentation implies their
                            authority and expert knowledge in the matter
                            without any further justification for

                            They tend to pick and choose opponents
                            carefully, either applying the hit-and-run
                            approach against mere commentators
                            supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier
                            attacks on key opponents who are known to
                            directly address issues. Should a
                            commentator become argumentative with any
                            success, the focus will shift to include the
                            commentator as well.</span><br

                            They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat
                            coincidentally with a new controversial
                            topic with no clear prior record of
                            participation in general discussions in the
                            particular public arena involved. They
                            likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no
                            longer of general concern. They were likely
                            directed or elected to be there for a
                            reason, and vanish with the reason.</span><br

                            They tend to operate in self-congratulatory
                            and complementary packs or teams. Of course,
                            this can happen naturally in any public
                            forum, but there will likely be an ongoing
                            pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort
                            where professionals are involved. Sometimes
                            one of the players will infiltrate the
                            opponent camp to become a source for straw
                            man or other tactics designed to dilute

                              Anti-conspiratorial.</span> They almost
                            always have disdain for 'conspiracy
                            theorists' and, usually, for those who in
                            any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO.
                            Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain
                            for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on
                            defending a single topic discussed in a NG
                            focusing on conspiracies? One might think
                            they would either be trying to make fools of
                            everyone on every topic, or simply ignore
                            the group they hold in such disdain. Or, one
                            might more rightly conclude they have an
                            ulterior motive for their actions in going
                            out of their way to focus as they do.</span><br

                              Emotions.&nbsp;</span> An odd kind of
                            'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually
                            thick skin -- an ability to persevere and
                            persist even in the face of overwhelming
                            criticism and nonacceptance. This likely
                            stems from intelligence community training
                            that, no matter how condemning the evidence,
                            deny everything, and never become
                            emotionally involved or reactive. The net
                            result for a disinfo artist is that emotions
                            can seem artificial. Most people, if
                            responding in anger, for instance, will
                            express their animosity throughout their
                            rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have
                            trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot
                            and cold with respect to pretended emotions
                            and their usually more calm or unemotional
                            communications style. It's just a job, and
                            they often seem unable to 'act their role in
                            character' as well in a communications
                            medium as they might be able in a real
                            face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You
                            might have outright rage and indignation one
                            moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger
                            later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to
                            being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism
                            will deter them from doing their job, and
                            they will generally continue their old
                            disinfo patterns without any adjustments to
                            criticisms of how obvious it is that they
                            play that game -- where a more rational
                            individual who truly cares what others think
                            might seek to improve their communications
                            style, substance, and so forth, or simply
                            give up.</span><br style="font-weight:

                            true self/motives. This may stem from not
                            really knowing their topic, or it may be
                            somewhat 'Freudian', so to speak, in that
                            perhaps they really root for the side of
                            truth deep within. I have noted that often,
                            they will simply cite contradictory
                            information which neutralizes itself and the
                            author. For instance, one such player
                            claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his
                            poor communicating skills (spelling,
                            grammar, incoherent style) on having only a
                            grade-school education. I'm not aware of too
                            many Navy pilots who don't have a college
                            degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a
                            particular topic/situation but later claimed
                            first-hand knowledge of it.</span><br

                            disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS
                            CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum
                            of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a
                            sit-down team discussion on response
                            strategy for best effect, and even enough
                            time to 'get permission' or instruction from
                            a formal chain of command. 3) In the NG
                            example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen
                            that bigger guns are drawn and fired after
                            the same 48-72 hours delay - the team
                            approach in play. This is especially true
                            when the targeted truth seeker or their
                            comments are considered more important with
                            respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus,
                            a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice
                            for the same sin.</span><br
