Thursday, February 18th, 2010</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">It&#8217;s being
called the<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"> largest {known}
research fraud in
medical history</span>. Dr.
Scott Reuben, a former member of Pfizer&#8217;s speakers&#8217; bureau, has agreed
to plead guilty to faking dozens of research studies that were
published in medical journals.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Now being
reported across the
mainstream media is the fact that Dr.
Reuben accepted a $75,000 grant from Pfizer to study Celebrex in 2005.
His research, which was published in a medical journal, has since been
quoted by hundreds of other doctors and researchers as &#8220;proof&#8221; that
Celebrex helped reduce pain during post-surgical recovery. There&#8217;s only
one problem with all this: <strong>No patients were ever enrolled in
the study!</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Dr. Scott
Reuben, it turns out, <em>faked
the
entire
study</em> and got it published anyway.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">It wasn&#8217;t
the first study faked
by Dr. Reuben: He also faked study
data on Bextra and Vioxx drugs, reports the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">As a result
of Dr. Reuben&#8217;s
faked studies, the peer-reviewed medical journal <em>Anesthesia &amp;
Analgesia</em> was forced to retract 10 &#8220;scientific&#8221; papers authored by
Reuben. <em>The Day</em>
of London reports that 21 articles written by Dr. Reuben that appear in
medical journals have apparently been fabricated, too, and must be
retracted.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">After being
caught fabricating
research for Big Pharma, Dr. Reuben
has reportedly signed a plea agreement that will require him to return
$420,000 that he received from drug companies. He also faces up to a
10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.</p>

</span>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Business
as usual in Big Pharma</h1>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">What&#8217;s
notable about this story
is not the fact that a medical
researcher faked clinical trials for the pharmaceutical industry. It&#8217;s
not the fact that so-called &#8220;scientific&#8221; medical journals published his
fabricated studies. It&#8217;s not even the fact that the drug companies paid
this quack close to half a million dollars while he kept on pumping out
fabricated research.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">The real
story here is that <strong>this
is
business
as usual in the pharmaceutical industry</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Dr.
Reuben&#8217;s actions really
aren&#8217;t that extraordinary. Drug
companies bribe researchers and doctors as a routine matter. Medical
journals routinely publish false, fraudulent studies. <strong>FDA
panel members regularly rely on falsified research</strong> in making
their drug approval decisions, and the mainstream media regularly
quotes falsified research in reporting the news.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Fraudulent
research, in
other words, is widespread in modern medicine</strong>.
The pharmaceutical industry couldn&#8217;t operate without it, actually. It
is falsified research that gives the industry its best marketing claims
and strongest FDA approvals. Quacks like Dr Scott Reuben are an
important part of the pharmaceutical profit machine because without
falsified research, bribery and corruption, the industry would have
very little research at all.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Pay special
attention to the
fact that the <em>Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</em>
medical journal gladly published Dr. Reuben&#8217;s faked studies even though
this journal claims to be a &#8220;scientific&#8221; medical journal based on peer
review. Funny, isn&#8217;t it, how such a scientific medical journal gladly
publishes fraudulent research with data that was simply invented by the
study author. Perhaps these medical journals should be moved out of the
non-fiction section of university libraries and placed under <em>science
fiction.</em></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Remember,
too, that all the
proponents of pharmaceuticals, vaccines
and mammograms ignorantly claim that their conventional medicine is all
based on &#8220;good science.&#8221; It&#8217;s all scientific and trustworthy, they
claim, while accusing alternative medicine of being &#8220;woo woo&#8221; wishful
thinking and non-scientific hype. Perhaps they should have a quick look
in the mirror and realize it is their own system of quack medicine
that&#8217;s based largely on fraudulent research, bribery and corruption.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">You just
have to laugh,
actually, when you hear pushers of vaccines
and pharmaceuticals claim their medicine is &#8220;scientific&#8221; while natural
medicine is &#8220;unproven.&#8221; Sure it&#8217;s scientific &#8212; about as scientific as
the storyline in a Scooby Doo cartoon, or as credible as the medical
license of a six-year-old kid who just received a &#8220;let&#8217;s play doctor&#8221;
gift set for Christmas. Many pharmaceutical researchers would have
better careers as writers of fiction novels rather than scientific
papers.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">For all
those people who
ignorantly claim that modern pharmaceutical
science is based on &#8220;scientific evidence,&#8221; just give them these three
words: <strong>Doctor Scott Reuben</strong>.</p>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Drug
companies support
fraudulent research</h1>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Don&#8217;t
forget that the drug
companies openly supported Dr. Scott
Reuben&#8217;s research. They paid him, in fact, to keep on fabricating
studies.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">The drug
companies claim to be
innocent in all this, but behind the
scenes they had to have known what was going on. Dr. Reuben&#8217;s research
was just too consistently favorable to drug company interests to be
scientifically legitimate. If a drug company wanted to &#8220;prove&#8221; that
their drug was good for some new application, all they had to do was
ask Dr. Reuben to come up with the research (wink wink). &#8220;Here&#8217;s
another fifty thousand dollars to study whether our drug is good for
post-surgical pain (wink).&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">And before
long, Dr. Reuben
would magically materialize a brand new
study that just happened to &#8220;prove&#8221; exactly what the sponsoring drug
company wanted to prove. Advocates of western medicine claim they don&#8217;t
believe in <em>magic</em>, but when it comes to clinical trials, they
actually do: All the results they wish to see just <em>magically appear</em>
as long as the right researcher gets paid to materialize the results
out of thin air, much like waving a magician&#8217;s wand and chanting, &#8220;Abra
cadabra&#8230; let there be RESEARCH DATA!&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Shazam! The
research data
materializes just like that. It all gets
written up into a &#8220;scientific&#8221; paper that also magically gets published
in medical journals that fail to ask a single question that might
exposed the research fraud.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">I guess
these people believe in
magic after all, huh? Where science
is lacking, a little &#8220;research magic&#8221; conveniently fills the void.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">The whole
system makes a mockery
of real science. It is a system
operated by criminals who fabricate whatever &#8220;scientific evidence&#8221; they
need in order to get published in medical journals and win FDA approval
for drugs that they fully realize are killing people.</p>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">What is
&#8220;Evidence-Based
Medicine?&#8221;</h1>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">The fact
that a researcher like
Dr. Reuben could so successfully
fabricate fraudulent study data, then get it published in peer-reviewed
science journals, and get away with it <strong>for 13 years</strong>
sheds all kinds of new light on what&#8217;s really behind &#8220;evidence-based
medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">The recipe
for evidence-based
medicine is quite simple: <em>Fabricate the evidence!</em> Get it
published in any mainstream medical journal. Then you can quote the
fabricated evidence as &#8220;fact!&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">When
pushers of pharmaceuticals
and vaccines resort to quoting &#8220;evidence-based medicine&#8221; as their
defense, keep in mind that <strong>much of their so-called evidence
has been entirely fabricated</strong>.
When they claim their branch of toxic chemical medicine is based on
&#8220;real science,&#8221; what they really mean is that it&#8217;s based on fraudulent
science but they&#8217;ve all secretly agreed to call it &#8220;real science.&#8221; When
they claim to have &#8220;scientific facts&#8221; supporting their position, what
they really mean is that those &#8220;facts&#8221; were fabricated by criminal
researchers being paid bribes by the drug companies.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">&#8220;Evidence-based
medicine,&#8221; it
turns out, hardly exists anymore. And even if it does, <em>how do you
know which studies are real vs. which ones were fabricated?</em> If a
trusted, well-paid researcher can get his falsified papers published <em>for
13
years</em>
in top-notch science journals &#8212; without getting caught by his peers &#8212;
then what does that say about the credibility of the entire peer-review
science paper publishing process?</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Here&#8217;s what
is says: &#8220;Scientific
medicine&#8221; is a total fraud.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">And this
fraud isn&#8217;t limited to
Dr Scott Reuben, either. Remember: he engaged in routine research fraud
<em>for 13 years</em>
before being caught. There are probably thousands of other scientists
engaged in similar research fraud right now who haven&#8217;t yet been caught
in the act. Their fraudulent research papers have no doubt already been
published in &#8220;scientific&#8221; medical journals. They&#8217;ve been quoted in the
popular press. They&#8217;ve been relied on by FDA decision makers to approve
drugs as &#8220;safe and effective&#8221; for widespread use.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">And yet
underneath all this,
there&#8217;s nothing more than fraud and
quackery. Sure, there may be some legitimate studies mixed in with all
the fraud, but <em>how can we tell the difference?</em></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><strong>How
are we to trust this
system that claims to have a
monopoly on scientific truth but in reality is a front for outright
scientific fraud?</strong></p>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Keep up
the great work, Dr
Reuben</h1>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Thank you,
Dr Scott Reuben, for
showing us the truth about the
pharmaceutical industry, the research quackery, the laughable
&#8220;scientific&#8221; journals and the bribery and corruption that characterizes
the pharmaceutical industry today. You have done more to shed light on
the true nature of the drug industry than a thousand articles on
NaturalNews.com ever could.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Keep up the
good work. After
paying your fine and serving a little
jail time, I&#8217;m sure your services will be in high demand at all the top
drug companies that need yet more &#8220;scientific&#8221; studies to be fabricated
and submitted to the medical journals.</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">You may be
a dishonest,
disgusting human being to most of the world, but you&#8217;re a huge asset to
the pharmaceutical industry and <em>they need you back!</em>
There are more studies that need to be fabricated soon; more false
papers that need to be published and more dangerous drugs that need to
receive FDA approval. Hurry!</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;">Because if
there&#8217;s one place
that extreme dishonesty is richly
rewarded, it&#8217;s in the pharmaceutical industry, where poisons are
approved as medicines and fiction is published as the truth.</p>

</div>
<p style="font-family: georgia,serif; font-weight: normal;"></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: normal;">The reason he paid
BigHarma &#8220;back&#8221; the $420,000 is so they can make
it look like in their little make believe world of lies that no crime
occurred, i.e. he paid us back so all is well. </p>
