    &nbsp;A comment on Talk: Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of
    China<br>
    1 hour ago: .<br>
    Besides Martin's gross jingoistic generalizations, <br>
    sweeping over simplifications, heavy reliance on<br>
    false dichotomies, assumptions that he knows <br>
    the Chinese better than Westerners, despite being<br>
    a Westerner himself, is laughable.<br>
    <br>
    His assumptions that anyone is "puzzled" is puzzling.<br>
    <br>
    Martin is a straight-up con-artist working for those who<br>
    have molded Chinese people into their own obedient <br>
    ROBOTS, whether they realize it or not: is now trying to <br>
    play them off his own people with complete treachery which<br>
    is not surprising when you consider what his type has done<br>
    to the Chinese people over the centuries, just read here:<br>

    4 days ago: .<br>
    Hi Gregory,<br>
    <br>
    Your goals are noble, and ones we share wholeheartedly.<br>
    <br>
    However you are 100% WRONG, that David's "system",<br>
    or any ELECTRONIC voting system for that matter, would<br>
    do anything but provide an impenetrable "deceit monopoly" <br>
    to a new "priest-class" that the entire world would be<br>
    at the mercy of, enforced by a police state that you <br>
    supposedly "voted" in !!!<br>
    <br>
    What is more, it would not even be <br>
    detectable, as the verification<br>
    process is such that mere mortals <br>
    would be convinced of its"veracity" <br>
    via techno-chauvinsim, and "expert" <br>
    interpretation.<br>
    <br>
    These "experts" would also be deceived <br>
    by the "high-priests" who "train" them.<br>
    <br>
    Thus the absolutely most important thing <br>
    for you to do Gregory, is to share this<br>
    truth as far and wide as you can <br>
    as soon as you can.<br>
    <br>
    HOWEVER, there is a sure fire <br>
    NO-TECH solution that REALLY<br>
    works, &amp; EVERYONE can <br>
    agree is 100% FAIL-SAFE <br>
    EVERYTIME.<br>

    Jan 10 2011: Furthermore, there can be no place for trust in the
    election<br>
    process precisely because the whole idea is to insure that the will
    of
    the<br>
    voters is expressed and that no one be able to subvert that process,<br>
    including those to whom trust is currently placed, who could then
    violate<br>
    that trust to perpetuate their vaunted position of being trusted in
    the<br>
    first place without being detected with unsecureable election
    methods
    such<br>
    as all EVS inherently are.<br>
    <br>
    Once the people's will has been expressed, THOSE who won the
    election
    NOW<br>
    have their trust, but not before.<br>
    <br>
    Hence it is only through a system that eliminates the need for trust<br>
    completely during the sacred election process itself that we can be
    assured<br>
    of this.<br>
    <br>
    here is that system: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

    Be well Ngan, and thanks for your participation in the discuss !!!<br>

    Jan 10 2011: Hi ngan, as soon as one mentions the words "officers",
    and<br>
    "have to show", all bets are off and anonymity is destroyed.<br>
    <br>
    The FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system has no "officers": we must not have two
    levels<br>
    of people, because when we do, we always end up with abuse,
    guaranteed
    !!!<br>
    <br>
    See how Mikko's excellent question is deftly handled<br>
    under FAIL-SAFE PROCEDURE DEFINED, section 5.7<br>
    here: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>
    <br>
    Also, each vote is sacred, big numbers mean nothing, &amp; must not
    be
    allowed<br>
    to be the basis for hiding things in big numbers. Besides, no EVS
    can
    insure<br>
    anyone their vote was corrected either, simply not possible, as it
    still<br>
    requires "faith" &amp; "trust" in others. As soon as you admit that,
    no
    matter<br>
    how many processes you wrap verification in, you still do not have<br>
    verification, only the possibility of it, and then the process
    becomes<br>
    social engineering, to make people beLIEve it is official because<br>
    "officials" were involved.<br>

    Excellent question Mikko<br>
    <br>
    Under our FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system, this is handled during the
    anonymous
    yet<br>
    PUBLIC verification stage PER precinct and just that vote is
    corrected,
    no<br>
    need to redo the entire election. <br>
    <br>
    please review here: goo.gl/mq3zh<br>
    <br>
    This is not possible in any electronic voting system, simply not
    possible<br>
    because it could still be wrong and the voter would only have
    received
    lip<br>
    service. <br>
    <br>
    And you are correct, liars can ruin many things, which is precisely
    why
    we<br>
    need a process to give the voters a chance to keep them out of
    office.<br>

    Yes indeed it is CV. <br>

    Here is the best way to do that which you describe: <a

    <br>
    It is important to note that David's system is naive, best case
    scenario.<br>
    <br>
    It appeals to techno-chauvinists, and is very dangerous in reality
    as it<br>
    creates a false sense of "security", yet in reality can only be
    "secured"<br>
    with a Police State to back it up, which makes voting meaningless
    anyway.<br>
    <br>
    Here is the system that does work however: <br>

    WITH<br>
    plausible deniability, then use all the fancy schmancy
    "cybersecurity"
    mumbo<br>
    jumbo to "certify" it, and once done, there is no way to prove they
    did
    it,<br>
    pretty scary huh, yet it is also true, they will then have a
    monopoly on<br>
    deceit, only "they" will be able to cheat, and no one can even prove
    that<br>
    they have, UNLESS we use this method which prevents its possibility<br>
    altogether straight out the gate, WITHOUT a POLICE STATE to "enforce
    it": <br>

    Nov 22 2010: Combine this with the FACT that since this algorithm is
    &amp; must<br>
    be published completely to be trusted at all, in the nevertheless
    always<br>
    untrustworthy Cybernetic domain, it is trivial to know the product
    PQ
    has<br>
    only TWO factors, i.e. P &amp; Q as primes dictate ! <br>
    <br>
    Even worse, even though there is no largest prime, they do thin out
    VERY<br>
    quickly as you go up, thus factoring them becomes a trivial matter
    even
    with<br>
    GARGANTUAN P &amp; Q, as they trail off in density inversely
    EXPONENTIALLY to<br>
    the natural log N, base e as N increases.<br>
    <br>
    So we have a VERY WELL KNOWN FIXED NON-MOVING TARGET, i.e. the
    primes,
    which<br>
    have been studied &amp; PUBLISHED since the earliest recorded times,
    whose<br>
    density drops off dramatically as you go up, THUS PK is ALL MYSTIQUE
    &amp;<br>
    BLUFF, as so few really have taken even the minimum amount of time
    to<br>
    understand it as we have laid it out above: each simply taking
    OTHERS
    word<br>
    for it, not realizing that they haven't looked into it either,

    x = MMI of a (mod y) simply means what integer value of x will make
    ax%y=1<br>
    <br>
    In other words, a times what integer when divided by y gives
    remainder=1?<br>
    <br>
    This x is the MMI of a (mod y), yes it is that simple.<br>
    <br>
    Thus we have d=MMI 3 (mod 4) = 7 because (3*7)/4=5 with remainder 1<br>
    <br>
    Our message, m=8<br>
    <br>
    We encrypt m giving us cyphertext c=m^e % N = 8*8*8 % 10 = 512 % 10
    = 2<br>
    <br>
    Thus P=2, Q=5, N=10, Z=4, e=3, d=7, m=8, c=2<br>
    <br>
    Now lets decrypt it and see if it is what we started with.<br>
    <br>
    m=c^d % N = 2^7 % 10 = 128 % 10 = 8 !!!! It works, and yes it is
    that<br>
    simple.<br>
    <br>
    NOW, lets see, the only thing we need to know is P &amp; Q and we
    get
    it all.<br>
    We know PxQ, just not P &amp; Q themselves. We also know e !!!!<br>
    <br>
    Thus we need only factor PxQ, how hard can that be, even if P&amp;Q
    are
    huge,<br>
    how bout not hard at all !!!<br>
    <br>
    WHY ? <br>
    <br>
    Well lets start off with the fact that the primes are FIXED never
    change,<br>
    and we know TONS of them already.<br>

    A. Cybernetic Voting cannot be secured without a Police State, under
    Police<br>
    State Dissent is impossible, thus reason enough not to use it.<br>
    B. Encryption that is not published completely cannot be trusted,
    that
    which<br>
    is, can be broken, no matter what anyone tells you as we will
    demonstrate<br>
    below, thus it too cannot be trusted since it can be broken.<br>
    C. The very people who can make complicated encryption are also
    smart
    enough<br>
    to trick YOU when you beLIEve a word they say.<br>
    D. Do not take anyone's word for item C, just know that it is true.
    <br>
    E. Virtual must remain the servant of Real<br>
    F. Real cannot be allowed to be changed by virtual, this would be
    akin
    to a<br>
    shadow controlling the one who cast it.<br>
    G. Just remember that the virtual in this case will be the shadow
    not
    of the<br>
    the voters, but of the one you cannot see yet does exist and must
    remain<br>
    encrypted, in its crypt to be able to operate, and thus must be
    forbidden by<br>
    the living from entering our physical realm or suffer the same fate.<br>

    can be completely obscured without anyone being able to prove it in<br>

    <br>
    Yet what did happen on election day is known, it is an event we

    really<br>
    think they will change everything just for you ? Get real. How do
    they
    know<br>
    you are not lying and just trying to cause trouble ? <br>
    <br>
    This is all bluff and feel good process obfuscation. <br>
    <br>
    They can work it backwards, i.e. see how everyone voted to see just
    how
    much<br>
    fraud is required to get their desired results.<br>
    <br>
    Then mathematically determine just how much fraud is necessary, then
    add in<br>
    only the fake votes necessary, spread it across as many precincts as<br>
    necessary to avoid attention, targeting precincts based on
    demographics
    that<br>
    provide plausible deniabilty. <br>

    Then using this cooked result, run it through all the "process", and

    Today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers among other<br>

    What do we know about prime numbers ?<br>

    Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are

    <br>
    It shrewdly exploits an asymmetry in awareness of legitimate

    cryptographic 'experts', being named such by others they have not

    aware<br>
    of this self-deception in their ranks, or that those who do know
    this
    choose<br>
    not to tell them precisely because it achieves the desired result of
    THEIR<br>
    BLUFF !!<br>
    <br>
    Which is to create a faith-based-religion that asserts that truth
    can be<br>
    hidden for a long enough time to prevent others from accessing it in
    a<br>
    timely manner, which assumes incorrectly the existence of 'time' as
    a<br>
    physical quality.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    There are many partial-truths. There is a partial-truth for every

    for every particle of the universe --for each one reflects
    everything
    else<br>

    finding THE truth that works for you and for the other guy, for now
    and<br>
    forever, in this place and everywhere, for the body and for the

    for<br>
    the sage and for the young, innocent child. <br>
    <br>
    The higher the partial-truth, the fewer boundaries it knows.<br>
    <br>
    Truth travels the world over, because wherever it goes, it is at

    <br>
    All truth is obvious and simple.<br>
    <br>
    Only lies are complex and require long winded explanations to
    "understand".<br>
    Many agree just because they do not want to appear stupid, when most
    times<br>
    that is who really is.<br>
    <br>
    Lies have to be complex because neither exist in reality where
    everything is<br>
    simple.<br>
    <br>
    Lies must be complex to hide the fact they are lies to as many as
    they
    can<br>
    get away with.<br>
    <br>
    If truth is not obvious to you, it means you have disconnected from<br>
    yourself, and are confusing things which do not belong together, and
    it<br>
    becomes a mystery to you.<br>
    <br>
    Complex does not exist in reality, only simplex relationships.<br>
    <br>
    Just because there are many simplex relationships does not mean that<br>
    complexity exists anymore than just because there are many
    individuals
    that<br>
    groups exist.<br>

    All so called "complex" systems can always be reduced into a set of

    Nov 15 2010: To develop this point further, we need look no deeper
    than
    if<br>
    even one bit is off, an entire election can be destroyed. Of course
    they are<br>
    bluffing so it's moot.<br>
    <br>
    Also, today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers.<br>
    <br>
    What do we know about prime numbers ?<br>
    <br>
    Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are
    fascinating
    to<br>
    be sure.<br>
    <br>
    Yet there is one very important aspect related to prime numbers that<br>
    ironically makes their use in cryptography inappropriate: thus
    renders<br>
    cryptography itself as the realm of bluffers extraordinaire,
    con-artists,<br>
    chiseler flimflammers rivaling televangelists &amp; fiatists in
    every
    way: their<br>
    retinue of mesmerized true-believers fully entranced.<br>
    <br>
    So what is it about prime numbers that makes this so ?<br>
    <br>
    It is the fact they are FIXED, KNOWN even PUBLISHED sufficiently !!<br>
    <br>
    Hello ?<br>

    unfathomable<br>
    perhaps, one can only wonder.<br>
    <br>
    As Simson Garfinkel states in his classic "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy"
    page<br>
    53, and others have in similar fashion elsewhere:<br>
    <br>
    "Many companies claim that their programs use proprietary encryption<br>
    algorithms. These companies assure you that their algorithms are
    secure
    but<br>
    nevertheless won't reveal the algorithms that their products use.
    Ask
    them<br>
    for details &amp; you're likely to be told, 'If we told you then the
    program<br>
    would be less secure.' You should avoid these programs; usually, the<br>
    companies don't reveal their encryption systems because they are
    embarrassed<br>
    by how easily the systems are broken. Remember, if the security of
    the<br>
    system is really depended on the secrecy of the algorithm, a
    determined<br>
    attacker would merely have to get a copy"<br>

    lives or<br>
    dies or who can speak.<br>
    <br>
    See democracy is based upon a bedrock of individual inalienable
    rights
    that<br>
    even democracy cannot infringe. Those rights begin and END with the<br>
    in-divid-ual. <br>
    <br>
    Only once those are secure can issues ABOVE those be determined via<br>
    democracy, and those determinations may not reach back down into the
    bedrock<br>
    of inalienable rights to impact them in any way, hence their being
    named<br>
    inalienable, inviolable.<br>
    <br>
    If the individual is considered sacred and protected, all groups
    will
    be as<br>
    well, as groups are all made up of individuals, so there is no such
    thing as<br>
    group rights, as all such notions always diminish the rights of the<br>

    There is no largest prime number.<br>

    1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.<br>

    3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p<br>
    4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series<br>

    no
    not<br>
    ever.<br>
    <br>
    CRYPTOGRAPHY is to protect the individual from the mob, not the
    other
    way<br>
    around.<br>
    <br>
    The real and only purpose of cryptography is to permit individuals
    to<br>
    communicate with each other with 100% privacy, and NOT for
    governments
    and<br>
    corporations to exercise tyranny over the individual, isolating it,<br>

    others to<br>
    enslave it, while making it believe it is free via mass mind
    control,<br>
    nefarious protocols, pharmacopoeia and most of all FAKE ELECTIONS. <br>
    <br>
    Cryptography's true purpose is to free us from each other on demand,
    when we<br>
    mutually choose or not, to enhance individuals ability to decide
    their
    own<br>
    fate, via 100% Privacy when desired with whom we choose to share it,
    to<br>
    exercise 100 % Freewill without ever inhibiting anyone else's

    work of<br>
    SPOOKS, the very type of people who can by definition NEVER be
    trusted
    with<br>
    anything, and MUST therefore be kept as far away from ELECTIONS as
    possible<br>
    it turns out. <br>
    <br>
    They are mutually exclusive in fact, fatally incompatible forever
    and
    ever,<br>
    so be it, so it is. <br>
    <br>
    We do however need white hat cryptographers to explain to others WHY<br>
    computers can NEVER be suitable for ELECTIONS, and other computer
    scientists<br>
    &amp; roboticists to explain what computers ARE good for, i.e.
    hypothesizing,<br>
    extrapolating, visualizing scenarios, controlling robotic systems,
    but
    NEVER<br>
    in the sacred process of ELECTING LEADERS, NEVER. <br>

    determining
    what<br>
    people want for the robots to produce it, so the ability to
    accurately<br>
    collect these wishes from the public is key. <br>

    3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p<br>

    Nov 13 2010: Roberto fails to see however that there have been ZERO
    replies<br>
    until these, it was as if no one could hear a thing, when in reality
    the<br>
    silence is a well known tactic in deception http://goo.gl/15fEE
    wherein
    you<br>
    simply ignore, as if it does not exist, any dissent, especially
    those
    that<br>
    hit the nail square through the board.<br>
    <br>
    So while you others and they go back and forth on minutia that does
    not<br>
    matter in the least precisely because it all takes place in an
    already<br>
    substantiated dead zone, they only gain credibility as the body of<br>
    "research" grows, even this TED Blog, to be pointed at later as
    being<br>
    copious discussion which proves their point, i.e. this was discussed<br>
    thoroughly, here read this, as the travesty then gains acceptance as<br>
    'TRUTH'.<br>
    <br>
    We see this time and time again in Land Use Abuses, Medicine,
    Climate<br>
    'Change', everywhere, the unfalsifiable assumption is king and the
    people<br>
    bow down to the altar of pseudo-science. You must read this to

    Nov 13 2010: Also please consider that a crypto system like the one
    being<br>
    suggested is so weak in reality that in order to implement it an
    entire<br>
    military command and control grid overlay is required, i.e. a police
    state,<br>
    and thus there is even more reason to doubt its results since no one
    can say<br>
    anything under such conditions, thus the only way again is this way:<br>

    Nov 13 2010: It appears that Sir David Bismark may be under the
    influence of<br>
    others, who isn't, in which case he is not completely responsible
    for
    his<br>
    participation in this charade perhaps. <br>
    <br>
    The point being that it is a charade, and the sooner he realizes it
    the<br>
    better, so he can salvage his good name and move on into building a
    REAL<br>
    system which must be along these lines <a
      href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a>,
    not
    one
    that<br>
    will only be used to fully immerse most of humanity under an
    electronic<br>
    spell where EVS and this behemoth http://goo.gl/GN4D combine to
    eliminate<br>
    the ability of the meek to exercise free will, while its architects
    run
    away<br>
    with all that is good and right, which in the end is not right of
    course,<br>
    hence why we are here to alert others, and David of course, bless
    his
    soul.<br>
    <br>
    Lest you or anyone else believe we are anti-technology, nothing
    could be<br>

    Nov 13 2010: Sir Richard, take your pick, they are either lying or<br>
    "learning", but after having watched David's youtube, am fairly sure
    David<br>
    is not intentionally deceiving, as far as that can be determined
    from<br>
    watching a video. He appears to be what is known as a true believer,
    when<br>
    all we are suggesting is that for something as serious as electing
    leaders,<br>
    that belief &amp; faith is the last thing we should be relying on.
    It
    must be<br>
    KNOWLEDGE, without tRUST of any kind. KNOWLEDGE MUST be TRUE to be<br>
    KNOWLEDGE. The same is not true of beLIEf, hence it, like tRUST,
    must be<br>
    completely eliminated from systems where life and death are
    concerned.<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, there have been countless examples of priest classes of<br>
    depraved psycho-paths who have commandeered scribes to come up with<br>
    elaborate tales to justify the priest class' hidden masters'
    domination
    over<br>
    others, and today is no exception: http://goo.gl/GN4D<br>

    experts<br>

    <br>
    Balderdash. <br>
    <br>
    Simply raising the bar of complexity to exclude those who have not
    deceived<br>
    themselves into "believing" their "latest" religion is not an excuse
    to<br>
    create a new priest class of so called "experts".<br>
    <br>
    Besides, this really is security thru obscurity, which means anyone
    who
    can<br>

    complexity where N is the most recent, but not the latest hidden

    There is a reason these "papers" are behind paywalls and in weird

    NOT because they are valuable, it is all bluff &amp; pretense, they
    have nothing<br>

    it<br>
    cannot act as a whole in an algorithm unless it is reconstituted at

    sniffing can<br>
    intercept the parts, or black bag teams can physically penetrate
    facilities<br>

    is

    Nov 13 2010: Furthermore, even if there is an adequate explanation
    for
    how<br>
    to create key shares and distribute them this only binds the
    participants<br>
    hands, not the one distributing the shares, besides in the end
    before we<br>
    even begin, and we must really only know this, it destroys
    everything ab<br>
    initio that follows our entrance into the dream world of cyberspace,
    it
    is<br>
    all operating within an insecure context, so it matters not if
    everything in<br>
    Alice in Wonderland is spelled correctly, it is just a false story,
    like<br>
    this:<br>
    <br>
    One sunny day in the middle of the night, <br>
    Two dead boys got up to fight.<br>
    Back to back they faced each other,<br>
    Drew their swords and shot each other.<br>
    A Deaf Policeman heard the noise, <br>
    came and killed the two dead boys.<br>
    If you do not believe this lie is true, <br>
    ask the blind man, he saw it too.<br>
    <br>
    Notice how there are no misspelled words, and the grammar is correct
    too,<br>

    the<br>
    indefensible: that once he realizes it, will be laughing at how

    becoming absurd ourselves.<br>
    <br>
    David, please provide YOUR understanding of how DistKeyGen works. As
    with<br>
    any concept, it is possible to prove a point in less than 1000
    characters. <br>
    <br>
    Like this: There is no largest prime number.<br>
    Proof.<br>
    1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.<br>
    2 Let p denote the largest prime number.<br>
    3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p<br>
    4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series<br>
    5 Thus q + 1 is either prime GT p, or has a prime factor GT p.<br>

    Nov 12 2010: The "protocol" for creating the key shares is
    controlled by<br>
    some nebulous, lurking unidentified entity, by clever design it
    turns
    out,<br>
    not surprisingly. <br>
    <br>
    It wishes it had not just been mentioned in fact, but is relying on
    most to<br>
    doubt its existence nevertheless, despite being told just now of its<br>
    existence and attempts to remain unnoticed.<br>
    <br>
    Granted none of those who subject themselves to the protocol, but
    the<br>
    intentionally unnamed entity who subjects others to the "protocol"
    is
    not<br>
    subject by definition, and necessarily, they would know the whole
    key,
    there<br>
    is no way to prevent that. <br>
    <br>
    That information then becomes very valuable and creates a cadre of
    insiders<br>
    who know it but tell everyone else they do not. This is how shadow<br>
    governments are created. Same as it ever was.<br>
    <br>
    We cannot and must not trust anyone as being more entitled to
    anything.<br>
    <br>
    Instead we should only use this very simple method that acknowledges
    that we<br>
    are all equal as its very basis. <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

    Nov 12 2010: David, just watched your Key Shares youtube, excellent<br>
    presentation. It is clear that you believe what you say is true,
    i.e.
    that<br>
    you appear to be genuine, but you need to step back and ask
    yourself,<br>
    wouldn't it be even better to KNOW what you say is true ?<br>
    <br>
    Granted all the "trusted" parties are lassoed into a system, but the<br>
    nebulous entity who is not, is still free to do whatever they want,
    i.e. the<br>
    controller of the algorithms, the custodian of the system itself is
    still<br>
    free to finagle behind the "process" which granted on the surface
    appears to<br>
    be very strong, giving a false sense of security, due to the ALWAYS
    possible<br>
    audacious END-RUN attack where you simply control the data itself
    that<br>
    everything else is run against, which would appear to produce VALID
    results,<br>
    but no one can know UNLESS this completely non-computer very simple
    process<br>
    is followed instead: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

    Nov 12 2010: The key point is that Computers are appropriate in many<br>
    applications, but not all, due to their ability to create
    cyberspace,
    that<br>
    place where no human can go, and the ease within which anything can
    be
    made<br>
    to be "true" via "say so".<br>
    <br>
    These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to
    visualize<br>
    and hypothesize ANYTHING, thus are the very weakness that prohibit
    their use<br>
    in the determination of PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP especially since it is
    not<br>
    required to do so per this solution: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a>
    no matter how<br>
    enticing it would be to be able to use them, just KNOW you cannot.<br>
    <br>
    Thus: "If it were appropriate we would, but as it is not we mustn't"<br>
    <br>
    So all talk about this &amp; that within the verboten context of EVS
    is
    itself<br>
    verboten. It is not as if we can massage it this way or that to make
    is<br>
    "right" it is a non-starter, do not even go there because you are
    WRONG

    Nov 12 2010: This is what Eric Blair calls DOUBLESPEAK...<br>
    <br>
    To say that a voter can verify how they voted to their self, but to
    no
    one<br>
    else is pure hokum. <br>
    <br>
    Likewise to say that software can be proven to have "worked" without
    having<br>
    to trust that it does not contain bugs, is also hokum and sophistry.<br>

    This is very dangerous to have so many caveatted aspects to a

    ? <br>
    <br>
    If there is no way to tell, then even the voter cannot be sure, is
    that
    not<br>
    what you have just said ? Come on man, snap to.<br>
    <br>
    Also, even if you do get a website to tell you who you cast your
    vote
    for,<br>
    that does not mean it was totaled correctly, REMEMBER the TWO SETS
    of
    BOOKS<br>
    Gambit that this scheme does NOT and CANNOT PREVENT simply because
    it,
    like<br>
    ALL E-Voting Systems cannot, please people, do we really have to
    keep<br>
    reminding you of this ?<br>
    <br>
    Besides if someone wants to buy votes, that is the choice of the
    seller, we<br>
    cannot get into all that, FREE WILL is FREE WILL, that is the whole
    point of<br>
    ELECTIONS, WE DECIDE WHO WE VOTE for, no one else. <br>

    Nov 12 2010: Josh Josh Josh, look at what you have said, "...the
    ability to<br>
    confirm your vote was counted, and counted correctly", have you the<br>
    wherewithal to see that E-Voting Systems in no way give you the
    ability
    to<br>
    do that, they simply make FRAUD that much easier, no more need to
    get in<br>
    there and fabricate physical evidence. Hackers are not the concern,
    it
    is<br>
    those at top who are the biggest concern, the hacker is just a
    boogie
    man to<br>
    blame and distract you from the super-criminals running the show.<br>
    <br>
    Yet there actually is a perfect voting system contrary to what you

    just does not matter since they decide who wins ahead of time, and

    Nov 11 2010: Good Gravy Michael, are you serious ? How many dolts
    are
    there<br>
    out there? We have already discussed all this ad nausem here, i.e.
    that
    just<br>
    because you can look up your vote when you get home, does not mean
    that
    the<br>
    RESULTS/TOTALS are sacrosanct, can you grasp that my friend ?
    Dawkins<br>
    introduced this exquisitely below.<br>
    <br>
    The education level really has dropped incredibly, there seem to be
    too
    few<br>
    who can think big picture, holographically out there. No wonder
    there
    is so<br>
    much corruption and chicanery. It is like stealing candy from
    babies.
    One<br>
    eyed man is king of the blind.<br>
    <br>
    Please come up to speed Michael my friend when you discover our
    perfect<br>
    voting system that GUARANTEES TRUE RESULTS EVERY-TIME WITHOUT TRUST
    of<br>
    ANYKIND and only uses technology that has been available for 10,000

    this
    is<br>
    somehow just a matter of making stew for the 3 little bears.<br>
    <br>
    Ah this one is just right, when what we are talking about has NO
    GREY

    unless of course you want to make some to hide stuff in and
    obfuscate

    for
    the<br>

    <br>
    Wake up while you still can, once the fools allow everyone to go
    fully
    under<br>
    VR, you will not need a body anymore, if you beLIEve that, what are
    you<br>
    waiting for, turn yours in right now, think of the convenience of
    everything<br>
    being virtual including your self !<br>
    <br>
    But alas, that is NOT why you are currently in a physical body now
    is
    it?<br>
    <br>
    We cannot be anti-physical chauvinists without leading to our own
    physical<br>
    disappearance.<br>
    <br>
    Take everything full out to test if you should even begin on that
    road,
    THAT<br>
    is the purpose of virtual, i.e. imagination, not to replace REALITY,
    but to<br>
    make it safer.<br>

    Nov 10 2010: Bismark continues to feign he wants to protect you, but
    know<br>
    this, he is either intentionally deceiving you, or is very confused,
    i.e.<br>
    blinded by the "science", best case scenario. <br>
    <br>
    For even knaves KNOW it is NOT possible to secure E-Voting systems.<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps Bismark has never been responsible for cash, and does not
    understand<br>
    that it IS possible to create NO-TRUST SYSTEMS, which are ALWAYS
    PHYSICAL in<br>
    nature. Think about the people who design casinos, bank vaults etc,
    they<br>
    must trust no one, since no one can be trusted. <br>
    <br>
    No math is required, only cold hard LOGIC, which while it can be
    conveyed to<br>
    others via a mathematical allegory, is nevertheless purely physical
    in<br>
    implementation and precisely why we cannot ever leave the physical
    and
    tell<br>
    people we are "fail-safe"<br>
    <br>
    The connection between physical &amp; virtual cannot be reversed,
    virtual can<br>
    only describe physical, but can never BE IT.<br>
    <br>
    All scams exploit knaves inability to understand this.<br>

    Nov 10 2010: Thank you David for providing the context to discuss
    the<br>
    obvious and TED for providing the forum in which to do so.<br>
    <br>
    A great way to see it is as follows.<br>
    <br>
    Challenge to ALL:<br>
    <br>
    Those who control what you beLIEve to be nebulous, control you
    without
    you<br>
    even knowing it: YET you, like them, can know, when you FREELY
    choose
    to NOT<br>
    beLIEve, and choose to ONLY know, ALWAYS.<br>
    <br>
    HOW YOU MUST FREELY CHOOSE TO RESPOND:<br>
    <br>
    So do not be nebulous. Be very clear on what is and what is not and
    never<br>
    can be.<br>
    <br>
    Likewise, no one can deceive you except you. All deception is<br>
    self-deception, especially when you are NOT aware of it. Those who
    are
    fully<br>
    awake see you fast asleep. Wise even warn you as your safety is
    theirs.
    How<br>
    do you know you are in a dream ? Isn't it enough to simply ask ?<br>
    <br>
    So be aware.<br>
    <br>
    This is why you exist in fact, and the only thing that keeps you
    here
    among<br>
    the living to forever keep you here whole.<br>

    Perspective Folks:<br>
    <br>
    Thesis:<br>
    <br>
    VR/Cyberspace can destroy REAL REALITY if we let mental defectives
    control<br>
    its rollout.<br>
    <br>
    Virtual Reality and cyberspace are valuable to humanity only when
    they<br>
    enhance REAL REALITY, not when they destroy it. <br>
    <br>
    If we allow CYBERSPACE to suck REAL REALITY into it via E-Voting
    Schemes<br>
    which by definition can NEVER be secured precisely because they
    create a<br>
    virtual reality where anything can be said to be true, whether it
    matches<br>
    physical reality or not.<br>
    <br>
    Mental Defectives are those who cannot differentiate between REAL
    REALITY<br>
    which always contains VIRTUAL REALITY, and VIRTUAL REALITY which can
    never<br>
    contain REAL REALITY, only represent it, since it is itself NOT
    reality.<br>
    Just as the map is not the territory, nor the menu the meal.<br>
    <br>
    VR can be used to help the blind see more REALITY, but must never be
    allowed<br>
    to blind those who can already see it, which is precisely why we
    cannot
    use<br>
    it for elections, but instead ONLY this: <a

    However, there is nothing to understand about ANY E-voting system
    other
    than<br>
    they can NOT EVER be secured PERIOD, before you even start, whether
    you
    get<br>
    it or not, save yourself the time and effort, it just is not
    possible,
    just<br>
    as there is no pot of gold at the end of rainbows, BY DEFINITION, a
    priori<br>
    NOT POSSIBLE<br>
    <br>
    This is because EVERY E-voting scheme REQUIRES TRUST.<br>
    <br>
    There however is a way where NO ONE &amp; NO THING need be trusted,
    and
    this my<br>
    friend is the NO-TEK solution that has been obfuscated for at least
    10,000<br>
    years precisely because it GUARANTEES a fair vote every single time,<br>
    something that Tyrants just cannot allow to be understood because it
    would<br>
    necessarily mean they do not get to be in power.<br>
    <br>
    YET it is SO EASY to understand &amp; implement that most just
    cannot
    see it,<br>
    that is just how jaded and faked out the masses have become.<br>

    Nov 9 2010: SS bogusly states: "However, in this system, voters have
    control<br>
    over who they have to trust." So do we elect these folks that we
    must<br>
    "trust" too, like the others ? Can't you even detect your own
    recursion
    ?<br>
    <br>
    SS, really takes the cake comparing one fraudulent system as the
    model

    another. <br>
    <br>
    Obfuscation you cannot detect that nevertheless exists by design
    above

    who<br>
    given the same question will give different answers, besides the

    basis<br>
    is flawed, and of course once you accept the flawed basis everything
    else is<br>
    "acceptable" to the weak minded.<br>
    <br>
    What type of work have you done SS that allows you to so cavalierly
    treat<br>
    the truth as if it did not really matter all that much, or perhaps,
    in
    your<br>

    are in the REAL room and can see how many REAL votes are on the
    board.
    Votes<br>
    that are not claimed are wiped from the board until the number of
    people and<br>
    votes match. This is REAL democracy, requiring JUST ONE day of REAL<br>

    <br>
    3. Since each vote is pure, each precinct is pure, since each
    precinct
    is<br>
    pure, each county is pure and so on. Since you cannot steal the

    two
    state<br>
    logic. <br>
    <br>
    Dawson asked the question quite straightforwardly, Bismark's answer
    assumes<br>
    we are idiots, as it does not address the "DOUBLE SET of BOOKs" nor
    the
    "END<br>
    RUN" gambits, either of which could give individuals answers they
    expect<br>
    while still stealing the election. <br>
    <br>
    High Quality Fraud systems can even reverse engineer paper trails
    real
    time<br>
    to fit desired outcomes without even "trusted" observers noticing to
    satisfy<br>
    all observations, all EXCEPT the all in one view afforded per
    precinct
    as it<br>
    unfolds @ end of day with all voters present per this:
    <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>
    hence your need use it and to abandon all other methods. <br>
    <br>
    The reason Bismark cannot address these issues is because it simply
    is
    not<br>
    possible to preclude such chicanery outside of this NO-TEK system

    A B C D vote for X. A has no clue who B C or D are or how they have
    voted. <br>

    All precinct Z votes &amp; deli codes are displayed on a giant board

    intellectual<br>
    depth, as well as inability to grasp the obvious is startling, but
    not<br>
    nearly as alarming as all the fools who take your "idea" seriously.<br>
    <br>
    Are we dealing with children here ? <br>
    <br>
    No sooner did we agree that NO TRUST is acceptable, did you then
    launch
    into<br>
    the specious "idea" that spreading it around somehow eliminates it,
    just as<br>
    evil industrialists, there are good ones too, want us to believe
    toxic
    waste<br>
    spread around by smoke stacks or used as fertilizer over millions of
    acres<br>
    some how gets rid of it.<br>
    <br>
    ZERO is ZERO, anything else is not. <br>
    <br>
    This system must have ZERO trust to be itself trusted, ZERO....<br>
    <br>
    There must be ZERO hiding places in a system that determines
    something
    as<br>
    sacred as who our leaders are. They must not be allowed to hijack it
    as
    you<br>
    say. <br>
    <br>
    The this is as good as it gets gambit will not do either.<br>
    <br>
    Only this NO-TEK system requires ZERO TRUST, thus is 100%
    trustworthy:<br>

    Bismark's system, and all E-systems, are FRAUDULENT straight out of

    believe they are somehow above the "regular" people, this is a

    concept of TRUTH.<br>
    <br>
    Thus we can have no system that hides any aspect of itself from

    think
    they<br>
    are smart... <br>
    <br>
    Yes any of you who entertain any sort of electronic voting system
    whatsoever<br>
    are all fools, as you do not understand first principles. <br>
    <br>
    There is no way to secure a system meant to tabulate the decisions
    of a<br>
    group of people unless that group of people does it themselves all
    at
    once<br>
    on the spot, which of course is possible. <br>
    <br>
    No different than other virtual problems like gold coin versus paper
    money.<br>
    Same thing.<br>
    <br>
    First principle, you cannot trust anyone, especially those to whom
    you
    have<br>
    given yours and your ability to take it back when they violate it.<br>
    <br>

    Nov 2 2010: BOGUS: The only way to verify a physical vote is to have<br>
    everyone who voted to view a single physical board per precinct with
    all the<br>
    votes cast displayed with a code next to each vote that each voter
    will
    be<br>
    able to view and acknowledge, or deny, that indeed that is how they
    voted by<br>
    matching it with the code they received when they cast their votes,
    without<br>
    of course revealing who they voted for, yes all of them must be
    present
    at<br>
    the same time, with no one dissenting, which can be done on a
    precinct
    by<br>
    precinct basis. There can be no electronics involved of any kind,
    none.<br>
    There simply is no other way, and yes it is as simple as this.<br>
    <br>
    As for logistics, voting is that important, that it must be an
    entire
    day<br>
    off, that is the least we can do for something this important, alas

    <br>
    Thanks for your cogent description of religion generically... <br>
    <br>
    I would like to agree with you on the generics and also delve deeper
    into<br>
    the historical application of these generics as described below in
    my
    post,<br>
    wherein it was discussed how the Roman Empire attempted to apply
    your<br>
    generics in the destruction of the only civilization to not bend its
    knee to<br>
    the Roman Juggernaut, and that in order to destroy Judaism, they<br>
    parasitically attached a new religion to Judaism, forged it to
    appear
    as a<br>
    natural progression from it, via the Jesus Story, and that as a
    result,
    they<br>
    not only attempted to steal the power of Judaism, they also created
    a
    huge<br>
    force that produced billions of robotic humans to toil endlessly
    generation<br>
    after generation, essentially throwaway disposable people, and that
    as a<br>
    result, we are delaying the advent of REAL LIFE EVERLASTING BEFORE
    DEATH,<br>
    via the Emancipation of Humanity from the Machinery of Economy
    through
    the<br>
    REAL ROBOTIC WAGELESS ECONOMY - http://RoboEco.com/ttenned<br>
    <br>
    And that moreover, the bullies who have coasted on this easy system
    of<br>
    domination of humans will never stop unless we intelligently
    transition, and<br>
    ironically are preventing themselves from living forever BEFORE
    death,<br>

    You existence proves everything you need to know, i.e. why is there
    not
    just<br>
    nothing ?<br>
    <br>
    You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
    terms<br>
    of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows
    whether
    it is<br>
    Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.<br>
    <br>
    That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we
    go
    back<br>
    in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
    should be<br>
    on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of
    "The<br>

    it
    goes<br>
    without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could

    <br>
    Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity

    an<br>
    effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
    catatonic/robotic<br>
    masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
    people<br>
    get on with ruling in "reality" ?<br>
    <br>
    If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a<br>
    conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and
    religion
    that<br>
    this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
    bend the<br>
    knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated
    via
    the<br>
    same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
    dogma<br>
    called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
    conquering<br>
    empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
    bully's<br>
    religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending<br>
    suffering forever unless checked once and for all?<br>
    <br>
    Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply<br>
    stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.<br>
    <br>
    If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,

    you expect for its adherents ?<br>

    correct ?<br>
    <br>
    Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make

    Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?<br>
    <br>
    Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?<br>
    <br>
    Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on

    It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who

    Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not<br>

    we
    know<br>
    our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly

    Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today<br>
    notwithstanding.<br>
    <br>
    In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures
    like an<br>
    archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
    Rabbi<br>
    Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org<br>
    <br>
    and<br>
    <br>
    Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures<br>
    <br>
    We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject<br>
    Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the
    Jews
    for<br>
    Jesus FrankenFaith.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their
    followers
    as<br>
    BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the
    whole
    deal,<br>
    and who is there to argue with you ?<br>
    <br>
    If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.<br>
    <br>
    At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from
    the<br>
    start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all
    trying to<br>
    gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents
    short,
    and<br>
    that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
    Scriptures<br>
    say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for<br>
    starters.<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone
    else's
    sins<br>
    !, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your
    sins!<br>
    <br>
    Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of
    accounting and<br>
    culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system
    of
    truth<br>
    and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,<br>
    effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be<br>
    manipulated at will.<br>
    <br>
    Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
    millions of<br>
    lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @
    the<br>
    coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an
    Age
    of<br>

    Mar 27 2008: Julia:<br>
    <br>
    You tell a great story and what you say about each of the religions
    you<br>
    mentioned makes a lot of sense.<br>
    <br>
    Here is something I wrote to Rick Warren and several others, please
    let
    me<br>
    know what you think.<br>
    <br>
    LET OUR PEOPLE GO !!!<br>
    <br>
    Instead of focusing only on what is good for one group, but instead
    on
    a way<br>
    where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The Inevitable Robotic
    Wageless<br>
    Economy", more on that below, but first, it goes without saying that
    the<br>
    attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue with as not being
    virtuous.<br>
    <br>
    This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too
    so
    we<br>
    are not taken for fools forever.<br>
    <br>
    If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
    highest<br>
    possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion,
    what
    do you<br>
    expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering"
    religion?<br>
    <br>
    Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
    exploitation of<br>
    Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating
    "holding<br>

    We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject<br>
    Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the
    Jews
    for<br>
    Jesus FrankenFaith.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their
    followers
    as<br>
    BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the
    whole
    deal,<br>
    and who is there to argue with you ?<br>
    <br>
    If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.<br>
    <br>
    At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from
    the<br>
    start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all
    trying to<br>
    gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents
    short,
    and<br>
    that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
    Scriptures<br>
    say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for<br>
    starters.<br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone
    else's
    sins<br>
    !, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your
    sins!<br>
    <br>
    Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of
    accounting and<br>
    culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system
    of
    truth<br>
    and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,<br>
    effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be<br>
    manipulated at will.<br>
    <br>
    Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
    millions of<br>
    lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @
    the<br>
    coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an
    Age
    of<br>
    Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy
    once
    and<br>
    for ALL !!!<br>

    &nbsp;A comment on Talk: Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren<br>
    Mar 26 2008: Dan:<br>
    <br>
    You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
    terms<br>
    of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows
    whether
    it is<br>
    Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.<br>
    <br>
    That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we
    go
    back<br>
    in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
    should be<br>
    on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of
    "The<br>
    Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first,
    it
    goes<br>
    without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could
    argue<br>
    with as not being virtuous.<br>
    <br>
    This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too
    so
    we<br>
    are not taken for fools forever.<br>
    <br>
    If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
    highest<br>
    possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion,
    what
    do you<br>
    expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering"
    religion?<br>
    <br>
    Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
    exploitation of<br>
    Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating
    "holding<br>
    pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a<br>
    meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still
    people<br>
    "naively" "debate" it.<br>
    <br>
    What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?<br>
    <br>
    Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity
    is
    an<br>
    effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
    catatonic/robotic<br>
    masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
    people<br>
    get on with ruling in "reality" ?<br>
    <br>
    If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a<br>
    conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and
    religion
    that<br>
    this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
    bend the<br>
    knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated
    via
    the<br>
    same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
    dogma<br>
    called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
    conquering<br>
    empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
    bully's<br>
    religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending<br>
    suffering forever unless checked once and for all?<br>
    <br>
    Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply<br>
    stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.<br>
    <br>
    If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,
    what do<br>
    you expect for its adherents ?<br>
    What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.<br>
    <br>
    Dan, thank you for being studious and interested in the truth in all
    things.<br>
    <br>
    This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also
    seems<br>
    appropriate here with some modification and specifically this
    preface.<br>
    <br>
    Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is
    very<br>
    important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman
    Empire,<br>
    from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?<br>
    <br>
    If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do
    the
    same<br>
    ? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations
    sacrifice,<br>
    correct ?<br>
    <br>
    Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make
    sense ?<br>
    Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?<br>
    <br>
    Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?<br>
    <br>
    Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on
    the<br>
    "unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my
    assertions<br>
    false, they must be true !???<br>
    <br>
    Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you
    know
    the<br>
    context.<br>
    <br>
    The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and<br>
    strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?<br>
    <br>
    Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for
    intentional<br>
    sins in any case. Study friend, study.<br>
    <br>
    Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for
    other<br>
    peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam
    and
    Eve's<br>
    sins.<br>
    <br>
    It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who
    never<br>
    questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible
    for
    their<br>
    "correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not
    questioning the<br>
    framework itself.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not<br>
    surprisingly, exploitative.<br>
    <br>
    Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way
    around,<br>
    agreed ?<br>
    <br>
    We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we
    really<br>
    get that upset about them ripping people off ?<br>
    <br>
    We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but
    keep in<br>
    mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT
    Christians,<br>
    and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when
    we
    know<br>
    our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly
    built
    on<br>
    our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered
    Jewish<br>
    Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today<br>
    notwithstanding.<br>
    <br>
    In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures
    like an<br>
    archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
