Besides Martin's gross jingoistic generalizations, <br>
sweeping over simplifications, heavy reliance on<br>
false dichotomies, assumptions that he knows <br>
the Chinese better than Westerners, despite being<br>
a Westerner himself, is laughable.<br>
<br>
His assumptions that anyone is "puzzled" is puzzling.<br>
<br>
Martin is a straight-up con-artist working for those who<br>
have molded Chinese people into their own obedient <br>
ROBOTS, whether they realize it or not: is now trying to <br>
play them off his own people with complete treachery which<br>
is not surprising when you consider what his type has done<br>

The truth behind why China's people <br>
are being propagandized against the<br>
west, a truth that you hopefully had <br>
nothing to do with, yet you need to KNOW<br>
about, to avoid being propagandized<br>

&nbsp;A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud<br>
4 days ago: .<br>
Hi Gregory,<br>
<br>
Your goals are noble, and ones we share wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>
However you are 100% WRONG, that David's "system",<br>
or any ELECTRONIC voting system for that matter, would<br>
do anything but provide an impenetrable "deceit monopoly" <br>
to a new "priest-class" that the entire world would be<br>
at the mercy of, enforced by a police state that you <br>
supposedly "voted" in !!!<br>
<br>
What is more, it would not even be <br>
detectable, as the verification<br>
process is such that mere mortals <br>
would be convinced of its"veracity" <br>
via techno-chauvinsim, and "expert" <br>
interpretation.<br>
<br>
These "experts" would also be deceived <br>
by the "high-priests" who "train" them.<br>
<br>
Thus the absolutely most important thing <br>
for you to do Gregory, is to share this<br>
truth as far and wide as you can <br>
as soon as you can.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, there is a sure fire <br>
NO-TECH solution that REALLY<br>
works, &amp; EVERYONE can <br>
agree is 100% FAIL-SAFE <br>
EVERYTIME.<br>
<br>
Please read about it here friend:<br>

&nbsp;A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud<br>
Jan 10 2011: Furthermore, there can be no place for trust in the
election<br>
process precisely because the whole idea is to insure that the will of
the<br>
voters is expressed and that no one be able to subvert that process,<br>
including those to whom trust is currently placed, who could then
violate<br>
that trust to perpetuate their vaunted position of being trusted in the<br>
first place without being detected with unsecureable election methods
such<br>
as all EVS inherently are.<br>
<br>
Once the people's will has been expressed, THOSE who won the election
NOW<br>
have their trust, but not before.<br>
<br>
Hence it is only through a system that eliminates the need for trust<br>
completely during the sacred election process itself that we can be
assured<br>
of this.<br>
<br>
here is that system: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

Jan 10 2011: Hi ngan, as soon as one mentions the words "officers", and<br>
"have to show", all bets are off and anonymity is destroyed.<br>
<br>
The FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system has no "officers": we must not have two
levels<br>
of people, because when we do, we always end up with abuse, guaranteed
!!!<br>
<br>
See how Mikko's excellent question is deftly handled<br>
under FAIL-SAFE PROCEDURE DEFINED, section 5.7<br>
here: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>
<br>
Also, each vote is sacred, big numbers mean nothing, &amp; must not be
allowed<br>
to be the basis for hiding things in big numbers. Besides, no EVS can
insure<br>
anyone their vote was corrected either, simply not possible, as it still<br>
requires "faith" &amp; "trust" in others. As soon as you admit that, no
matter<br>
how many processes you wrap verification in, you still do not have<br>
verification, only the possibility of it, and then the process becomes<br>
social engineering, to make people beLIEve it is official because<br>
"officials" were involved.<br>

Jan 10 2011: .<br>
Excellent question Mikko<br>
<br>
Under our FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system, this is handled during the anonymous
yet<br>
PUBLIC verification stage PER precinct and just that vote is corrected,
no<br>
need to redo the entire election. <br>
<br>
please review here: goo.gl/mq3zh<br>
<br>
This is not possible in any electronic voting system, simply not
possible<br>
because it could still be wrong and the voter would only have received
lip<br>
service. <br>
<br>
And you are correct, liars can ruin many things, which is precisely why
we<br>
need a process to give the voters a chance to keep them out of office.<br>

<br>
Here is the best way to do that which you describe: <a

<br>
It is important to note that David's system is naive, best case
scenario.<br>
<br>
It appeals to techno-chauvinists, and is very dangerous in reality as it<br>
creates a false sense of "security", yet in reality can only be
"secured"<br>
with a Police State to back it up, which makes voting meaningless
anyway.<br>

Here is the system that does work however: <br>

<br>
THERE IS NO WAY to PREVENT THIS except this way: <a

<br>
In fact, electronically, real time, they can fake only the exact number
they<br>
need to, the needle in the hay-stack gambit, to get the desired outcome
WITH<br>
plausible deniability, then use all the fancy schmancy "cybersecurity"
mumbo<br>
jumbo to "certify" it, and once done, there is no way to prove they did
it,<br>
pretty scary huh, yet it is also true, they will then have a monopoly on<br>
deceit, only "they" will be able to cheat, and no one can even prove
that<br>
they have, UNLESS we use this method which prevents its possibility<br>
altogether straight out the gate, WITHOUT a POLICE STATE to "enforce
it": <br>

Nov 22 2010: Combine this with the FACT that since this algorithm is
&amp; must<br>
be published completely to be trusted at all, in the nevertheless always<br>
untrustworthy Cybernetic domain, it is trivial to know the product PQ
has<br>
only TWO factors, i.e. P &amp; Q as primes dictate ! <br>
<br>
Even worse, even though there is no largest prime, they do thin out VERY<br>
quickly as you go up, thus factoring them becomes a trivial matter even
with<br>
GARGANTUAN P &amp; Q, as they trail off in density inversely
EXPONENTIALLY to<br>
the natural log N, base e as N increases.<br>
<br>
So we have a VERY WELL KNOWN FIXED NON-MOVING TARGET, i.e. the primes,
which<br>
have been studied &amp; PUBLISHED since the earliest recorded times,
whose<br>
density drops off dramatically as you go up, THUS PK is ALL MYSTIQUE
&amp;<br>
BLUFF, as so few really have taken even the minimum amount of time to<br>
understand it as we have laid it out above: each simply taking OTHERS
word<br>
for it, not realizing that they haven't looked into it either, FOOLS.<br>

Nov 22 2010: .<br>
x = MMI of a (mod y) simply means what integer value of x will make
ax%y=1<br>
<br>
In other words, a times what integer when divided by y gives
remainder=1?<br>
<br>
This x is the MMI of a (mod y), yes it is that simple.<br>
<br>
Thus we have d=MMI 3 (mod 4) = 7 because (3*7)/4=5 with remainder 1<br>
<br>
Our message, m=8<br>
<br>
We encrypt m giving us cyphertext c=m^e % N = 8*8*8 % 10 = 512 % 10 = 2<br>
<br>
Thus P=2, Q=5, N=10, Z=4, e=3, d=7, m=8, c=2<br>
<br>
Now lets decrypt it and see if it is what we started with.<br>
<br>
m=c^d % N = 2^7 % 10 = 128 % 10 = 8 !!!! It works, and yes it is that<br>
simple.<br>
<br>
NOW, lets see, the only thing we need to know is P &amp; Q and we get
it all.<br>
We know PxQ, just not P &amp; Q themselves. We also know e !!!!<br>
<br>
Thus we need only factor PxQ, how hard can that be, even if P&amp;Q are
huge,<br>
how bout not hard at all !!!<br>
<br>
WHY ? <br>
<br>
Well lets start off with the fact that the primes are FIXED never
change,<br>
and we know TONS of them already.<br>

Nov 22 2010: But as you appear to want to understand how cryptography
works,<br>
please read the following, it is very simple as all truth is, and is
very<br>
important for the individual to understand and use with other
individuals as<br>
needed to protect the individual from the State as the State is the
biggest<br>
mass murderer of all time when armed with technologies meant to serve
only<br>
the individual, hope this fine yet most importatnt distinction is clear
to<br>
everyone. <br>
<br>
It is similar to all classic philisophical razor edge distinctions, e.g.<br>
what is appropriate in one context, and most beautiful etc, can be<br>
completely horrid &amp; deadly in another, same exact thing, just wrong
context,<br>
catastrophic outcome.<br>
<br>
Now please how easy it is to understand and thus break the following:<br>
<br>
Public Key Encryption EXACTLY as it is:<br>
<br>
P=2, Q=5 are Prime<br>
N=PQ=10<br>
Z=(P-1)(Q-1)=4<br>
encryption key e=3, can be anything coprime to Z<br>
Public Key is N &amp; e<br>
Private Key d is MMI = modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod Z)<br>

A. Cybernetic Voting cannot be secured without a Police State, under
Police<br>
State Dissent is impossible, thus reason enough not to use it.<br>
B. Encryption that is not published completely cannot be trusted, that
which<br>
is, can be broken, no matter what anyone tells you as we will
demonstrate<br>
below, thus it too cannot be trusted since it can be broken.<br>
C. The very people who can make complicated encryption are also smart
enough<br>
to trick YOU when you beLIEve a word they say.<br>
D. Do not take anyone's word for item C, just know that it is true. <br>
E. Virtual must remain the servant of Real<br>
F. Real cannot be allowed to be changed by virtual, this would be akin
to a<br>
shadow controlling the one who cast it.<br>

It is not as though we are trying to predict the weather 40 days from

an event which actually took place in non-cyber real reality, totals
that<br>
can be completely obscured without anyone being able to prove it in<br>
cyberspace, no matter what!<br>

Yet what did happen on election day is known, it is an event we control

even invited everyone to participate in for crying out loud.<br>

Nov 17 2010: Great question Sameer, they cannot, it is not possible,
you can<br>
only see that your vote is correct. And what if it isn't, do you really<br>
think they will change everything just for you ? Get real. How do they
know<br>
you are not lying and just trying to cause trouble ? <br>
<br>
This is all bluff and feel good process obfuscation. <br>
<br>
They can work it backwards, i.e. see how everyone voted to see just how
much<br>
fraud is required to get their desired results.<br>
<br>
Then mathematically determine just how much fraud is necessary, then
add in<br>
only the fake votes necessary, spread it across as many precincts as<br>
necessary to avoid attention, targeting precincts based on demographics
that<br>
provide plausible deniabilty. <br>
<br>
Then using this cooked result, run it through all the "process", and
voila<br>
"irrefutable" proof.<br>

It shrewdly exploits an asymmetry in awareness of legitimate

principles, to foist a fraud on even those who merely BELIEVE they are<br>
cryptographic 'experts', being named such by others they have not
pondered<br>
deeply enough that those who have named them such are themselves not

of this self-deception in their ranks, or that those who do know this
choose<br>
not to tell them precisely because it achieves the desired result of
THEIR<br>
BLUFF !!<br>

Which is to create a faith-based-religion that asserts that truth can be<br>
hidden for a long enough time to prevent others from accessing it in a<br>
timely manner, which assumes incorrectly the existence of 'time' as a<br>
physical quality.<br>

This is the crux.<br>

As time does not exist in physical reality, there is no way to use it to<br>

ELECTIONS &amp; just not cryptography, as it only serves to enable
those who<br>

would never even be interested in doing so, thus it must be banned from<br>
state altogether so we do not have to wonder whether it has been

or not.<br>

<br>
There are many partial-truths. There is a partial-truth for every being
and<br>
for every particle of the universe --for each one reflects everything
else<br>
in a different way.<br>
<br>
To seek truth means more than finding your own partial-truth. It means<br>
finding THE truth that works for you and for the other guy, for now and<br>
forever, in this place and everywhere, for the body and for the soul,
for<br>
the sage and for the young, innocent child. <br>

The higher the partial-truth, the fewer boundaries it knows.<br>

Truth travels the world over, because wherever it goes, it is at least<br>
partially rejected and must move on.<br>

Partial-truth is always a FOUL LIE, for every lie is a sentence that has<br>
true words in it. <br>

Nov 15 2010: Only self-evident truth is true, is very simple to
understand.<br>
<br>
All truth is obvious and simple.<br>
<br>
Only lies are complex and require long winded explanations to
"understand".<br>
Many agree just because they do not want to appear stupid, when most
times<br>
that is who really is.<br>
<br>
Lies have to be complex because neither exist in reality where
everything is<br>
simple.<br>
<br>
Lies must be complex to hide the fact they are lies to as many as they
can<br>
get away with.<br>
<br>
If truth is not obvious to you, it means you have disconnected from<br>
yourself, and are confusing things which do not belong together, and it<br>
becomes a mystery to you.<br>
<br>
Complex does not exist in reality, only simplex relationships.<br>
<br>
Just because there are many simplex relationships does not mean that<br>
complexity exists anymore than just because there are many individuals
that<br>
groups exist.<br>

Nov 15 2010: Sir Richard, above you mention in so many words that you
will<br>
conclude nothing until a so called "expert" says so. That is what we
call<br>
"say so".<br>
<br>
As if others should do your work for you. Today more than ever,
although it<br>
was always true, WE OURSELVES MUST and CAN BE the "expert".<br>
<br>
Dependency on others is weak &amp; very dangerous.<br>
<br>
It brings out contempt in those who do know especially when they are<br>
expected to work for the lazy who do not even bother to see the obvious.<br>
<br>
Only self-evident truth is true. Same with self-deception, it is always
the<br>
self that deceives the self, no one else can deceive you.<br>
<br>
If they can know, you can know unless you are admitting some mental
defect<br>
of course.<br>
<br>
If someone can know, you can know too, or that which is claimed to be
known<br>
in fact cannot be. Alas, the precisely the point.<br>
<br>
Until and unless you reduce everything to that simple logic, you will<br>
forever tRUST and be betrayed by those you thought were doing work you
could<br>
have done yourself.<br>

Nov 15 2010: Herein lies the paradox, no matter what cryptographic
technique<br>
employed, to be trusted it must be published, if published it can be<br>
understood &amp; thus broken, hence not trusted. Whatever can be known
cannot be<br>
hidden.<br>
<br>
Philosophically, the reason this is true is because TRUTH's very nature
is<br>
to be known, NOT hidden.<br>
<br>
Like a beach ball resists being held underwater.<br>
<br>
Only lies must be hidden from the truth which renders them what they
are,<br>
lies.<br>
<br>
Never mind the SELF-EVIDENT fact that Cyberspace is the place no human
can<br>
go with their body, and thus is the place where PHYSICAL ELECTIONS
CANNOT<br>
take place as virtual may only serve physical, never determine it. Can<br>
shadow control body?<br>
<br>
Voters exist in physical reality with physical needs that elections are<br>
meant to serve.<br>
<br>
Cyberspace: place where anything can happen is NOT bound in anyway to<br>
physical reality, or what really happened: same as beLIEf.<br>

Nov 15 2010: To develop this point further, we need look no deeper than
if<br>
even one bit is off, an entire election can be destroyed. Of course
they are<br>
bluffing so it's moot.<br>
<br>
Also, today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers.<br>
<br>
What do we know about prime numbers ?<br>
<br>
Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are fascinating
to<br>
be sure.<br>
<br>
Yet there is one very important aspect related to prime numbers that<br>
ironically makes their use in cryptography inappropriate: thus renders<br>
cryptography itself as the realm of bluffers extraordinaire,
con-artists,<br>
chiseler flimflammers rivaling televangelists &amp; fiatists in every
way: their<br>
retinue of mesmerized true-believers fully entranced.<br>
<br>
So what is it about prime numbers that makes this so ?<br>
<br>
It is the fact they are FIXED, KNOWN even PUBLISHED sufficiently !!<br>

or even<br>
a description in their OWN words of how their system works is
unfathomable<br>
perhaps, one can only wonder.<br>
<br>
As Simson Garfinkel states in his classic "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy"
page<br>
53, and others have in similar fashion elsewhere:<br>
<br>
"Many companies claim that their programs use proprietary encryption<br>
algorithms. These companies assure you that their algorithms are secure
but<br>
nevertheless won't reveal the algorithms that their products use. Ask
them<br>
for details &amp; you're likely to be told, 'If we told you then the
program<br>
would be less secure.' You should avoid these programs; usually, the<br>
companies don't reveal their encryption systems because they are
embarrassed<br>
by how easily the systems are broken. Remember, if the security of the<br>
system is really depended on the secrecy of the algorithm, a determined<br>
attacker would merely have to get a copy"<br>

ERIC BLAIR a TRUE British Elite unlike others, whose pen name was George<br>

DOUBLETHINK<br>
<br>
The ability to hold at least two contradictory ideas in the mind without<br>
experiencing cognitive dissonance.<br>
<br>
DOUBLESPEAK<br>
<br>
The ability to speak or write two or more contradictory ideas without
the<br>
speaker or writer being consciously aware of the contradiction.
Doublespeak<br>
may be, and probably is, consciously used to deceive.<br>

It is very dangerous to witness DOUBLE SPEAK, and NOT SPEAK up about it.<br>

Nov 14 2010: Greg Greg Greg, we ELECT LEADERS, we do not decide who
lives or<br>
dies or who can speak.<br>
<br>
See democracy is based upon a bedrock of individual inalienable rights
that<br>
even democracy cannot infringe. Those rights begin and END with the<br>
in-divid-ual. <br>
<br>
Only once those are secure can issues ABOVE those be determined via<br>
democracy, and those determinations may not reach back down into the
bedrock<br>
of inalienable rights to impact them in any way, hence their being named<br>
inalienable, inviolable.<br>
<br>
If the individual is considered sacred and protected, all groups will
be as<br>
well, as groups are all made up of individuals, so there is no such
thing as<br>
group rights, as all such notions always diminish the rights of the<br>
individual.<br>
<br>
Hence the need to protect the sanctity of ELECTIONS, and prohibit

Nov 14 2010: Cryptography is a great thing, just not for Elections, no
not<br>
ever.<br>
<br>
CRYPTOGRAPHY is to protect the individual from the mob, not the other
way<br>
around.<br>
<br>
The real and only purpose of cryptography is to permit individuals to<br>
communicate with each other with 100% privacy, and NOT for governments
and<br>
corporations to exercise tyranny over the individual, isolating it,<br>
atomizing it, separating it from its own life, from itself and others to<br>
enslave it, while making it believe it is free via mass mind control,<br>
nefarious protocols, pharmacopoeia and most of all FAKE ELECTIONS. <br>
<br>
Cryptography's true purpose is to free us from each other on demand,
when we<br>
mutually choose or not, to enhance individuals ability to decide their
own<br>
fate, via 100% Privacy when desired with whom we choose to share it, to<br>
exercise 100 % Freewill without ever inhibiting anyone else's ability
to do<br>
the same as WE-R&copy;, Plural of I AM<br>

work of<br>
SPOOKS, the very type of people who can by definition NEVER be trusted
with<br>
anything, and MUST therefore be kept as far away from ELECTIONS as
possible<br>
it turns out. <br>
<br>
They are mutually exclusive in fact, fatally incompatible forever and
ever,<br>
so be it, so it is. <br>
<br>
We do however need white hat cryptographers to explain to others WHY<br>
computers can NEVER be suitable for ELECTIONS, and other computer
scientists<br>
&amp; roboticists to explain what computers ARE good for, i.e.
hypothesizing,<br>
extrapolating, visualizing scenarios, controlling robotic systems, but
NEVER<br>
in the sacred process of ELECTING LEADERS, NEVER. <br>
<br>
With Wageless Economy Robotic&copy;, we MUST have a way of determining
what<br>
people want for the robots to produce it, so the ability to accurately<br>
collect these wishes from the public is key. <br>

is not intentionally deceiving, as far as that can be determined from<br>
watching a video. He appears to be what is known as a true believer,
when<br>
all we are suggesting is that for something as serious as electing
leaders,<br>
that belief &amp; faith is the last thing we should be relying on. It
must be<br>
KNOWLEDGE, without tRUST of any kind. KNOWLEDGE MUST be TRUE to be<br>
KNOWLEDGE. The same is not true of beLIEf, hence it, like tRUST, must be<br>
completely eliminated from systems where life and death are concerned.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there have been countless examples of priest classes of<br>
depraved psycho-paths who have commandeered scribes to come up with<br>
elaborate tales to justify the priest class' hidden masters' domination
over<br>
others, and today is no exception: http://goo.gl/GN4D<br>

Simply raising the bar of complexity to exclude those who have not

create a new priest class of so called "experts".<br>
<br>
Besides, this really is security thru obscurity, which means anyone who
can<br>
figure it out can get in, we need something real, not just N+1 layers of<br>
complexity where N is the most recent, but not the latest hidden

together<br>
at some point to be used. Just because its parts are hither and yon, it<br>
cannot act as a whole in an algorithm unless it is reconstituted at
least<br>
once. Besides, even in transit from different locations, packet
sniffing can<br>
intercept the parts, or black bag teams can physically penetrate

Nov 13 2010: Furthermore, even if there is an adequate explanation for
how<br>
to create key shares and distribute them this only binds the
participants<br>
hands, not the one distributing the shares, besides in the end before we<br>
even begin, and we must really only know this, it destroys everything ab<br>
initio that follows our entrance into the dream world of cyberspace, it
is<br>
all operating within an insecure context, so it matters not if
everything in<br>
Alice in Wonderland is spelled correctly, it is just a false story, like<br>
this:<br>
<br>
One sunny day in the middle of the night, <br>
Two dead boys got up to fight.<br>
Back to back they faced each other,<br>
Drew their swords and shot each other.<br>
A Deaf Policeman heard the noise, <br>
came and killed the two dead boys.<br>
If you do not believe this lie is true, <br>
ask the blind man, he saw it too.<br>
<br>
Notice how there are no misspelled words, and the grammar is correct
too,<br>

it<br>
was to think it was possible to secure the insecurable. <br>

sticking with it but we mustn't humor the absurd too long for risk of<br>
becoming absurd ourselves.<br>
<br>
David, please provide YOUR understanding of how DistKeyGen works. As
with<br>
any concept, it is possible to prove a point in less than 1000
characters. <br>
<br>
Like this: There is no largest prime number.<br>
Proof.<br>
1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.<br>
2 Let p denote the largest prime number.<br>
3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p<br>
4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series<br>
5 Thus q + 1 is either prime GT p, or has a prime factor GT p.<br>

Nov 12 2010: The "protocol" for creating the key shares is controlled by<br>
some nebulous, lurking unidentified entity, by clever design it turns
out,<br>
not surprisingly. <br>
<br>
It wishes it had not just been mentioned in fact, but is relying on
most to<br>
doubt its existence nevertheless, despite being told just now of its<br>
existence and attempts to remain unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Granted none of those who subject themselves to the protocol, but the<br>
intentionally unnamed entity who subjects others to the "protocol" is
not<br>
subject by definition, and necessarily, they would know the whole key,
there<br>
is no way to prevent that. <br>
<br>
That information then becomes very valuable and creates a cadre of
insiders<br>
who know it but tell everyone else they do not. This is how shadow<br>
governments are created. Same as it ever was.<br>
<br>
We cannot and must not trust anyone as being more entitled to anything.<br>
<br>
Instead we should only use this very simple method that acknowledges
that we<br>
are all equal as its very basis. <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

Nov 12 2010: David, just watched your Key Shares youtube, excellent<br>
presentation. It is clear that you believe what you say is true, i.e.
that<br>
you appear to be genuine, but you need to step back and ask yourself,<br>
wouldn't it be even better to KNOW what you say is true ?<br>
<br>
Granted all the "trusted" parties are lassoed into a system, but the<br>
nebulous entity who is not, is still free to do whatever they want,
i.e. the<br>
controller of the algorithms, the custodian of the system itself is
still<br>
free to finagle behind the "process" which granted on the surface
appears to<br>
be very strong, giving a false sense of security, due to the ALWAYS
possible<br>
audacious END-RUN attack where you simply control the data itself that<br>
everything else is run against, which would appear to produce VALID
results,<br>
but no one can know UNLESS this completely non-computer very simple
process<br>
is followed instead: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>

what you want it to be. All the twists and turns and "process" are<br>

Nov 12 2010: The key point is that Computers are appropriate in many<br>
applications, but not all, due to their ability to create cyberspace,
that<br>
place where no human can go, and the ease within which anything can be
made<br>
to be "true" via "say so".<br>
<br>
These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to
visualize<br>
and hypothesize ANYTHING, thus are the very weakness that prohibit
their use<br>
in the determination of PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP especially since it is not<br>
required to do so per this solution: <a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a>

LAYER ONE: WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED on ELECTION DAY is the most important

obfuscate<br>
the FACT that no matter what pattern of bits you present as PROOF, it
can<br>
always be CONTRIVED AFTER the FACT &amp; presented to you as PROOF !!
HELLO ???? <br>

Do NOT be hypnotized by all the twisted turns of the "process" just step<br>
back and REVERSE ENGINEER it, i.e. start off with what you wish to end
up<br>
with and MAKE IT SO, using the very processes touted as that which would<br>
prevent such !!!<br>

This is precisely why the recording industry can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
about<br>
people making copies of STUFF, unless they damage the RECEIVER of<br>
information itself, i.e. the people. If we can play it, we can record
it,<br>
this is FUNDAMENTAL.<br>
<br>
According to their insane logic, soon they will outlaw remembering
anything<br>
because that would be an unauthorized replay according to these mental<br>

It is JUST as self-evident to the awake that E-Voting Schemes are NOT<br>

We have already clearly established to everyone RIGHT HERE, that ALL

are NOT in clear view at ALL TIMES to EVERYONE voting. <br>

Nov 10 2010: Bismark continues to feign he wants to protect you, but
know<br>
this, he is either intentionally deceiving you, or is very confused,
i.e.<br>
blinded by the "science", best case scenario. <br>
<br>
For even knaves KNOW it is NOT possible to secure E-Voting systems.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Bismark has never been responsible for cash, and does not
understand<br>
that it IS possible to create NO-TRUST SYSTEMS, which are ALWAYS
PHYSICAL in<br>
nature. Think about the people who design casinos, bank vaults etc, they<br>
must trust no one, since no one can be trusted. <br>
<br>
No math is required, only cold hard LOGIC, which while it can be
conveyed to<br>
others via a mathematical allegory, is nevertheless purely physical in<br>
implementation and precisely why we cannot ever leave the physical and
tell<br>
people we are "fail-safe"<br>
<br>
The connection between physical &amp; virtual cannot be reversed,
virtual can<br>
only describe physical, but can never BE IT.<br>

All scams exploit knaves inability to understand this.<br>

<br>
A great way to see it is as follows.<br>
<br>
Challenge to ALL:<br>
<br>
Those who control what you beLIEve to be nebulous, control you without
you<br>
even knowing it: YET you, like them, can know, when you FREELY choose
to NOT<br>
beLIEve, and choose to ONLY know, ALWAYS.<br>
<br>
HOW YOU MUST FREELY CHOOSE TO RESPOND:<br>
<br>
So do not be nebulous. Be very clear on what is and what is not and
never<br>
can be.<br>
<br>
Likewise, no one can deceive you except you. All deception is<br>
self-deception, especially when you are NOT aware of it. Those who are
fully<br>
awake see you fast asleep. Wise even warn you as your safety is theirs.
How<br>
do you know you are in a dream ? Isn't it enough to simply ask ?<br>
<br>
So be aware.<br>
<br>
This is why you exist in fact, and the only thing that keeps you here
among<br>
the living to forever keep you here whole.<br>

Perspective Folks:<br>
<br>
Thesis:<br>
<br>
VR/Cyberspace can destroy REAL REALITY if we let mental defectives
control<br>
its rollout.<br>
<br>
Virtual Reality and cyberspace are valuable to humanity only when they<br>
enhance REAL REALITY, not when they destroy it. <br>
<br>
If we allow CYBERSPACE to suck REAL REALITY into it via E-Voting Schemes<br>
which by definition can NEVER be secured precisely because they create a<br>
virtual reality where anything can be said to be true, whether it
matches<br>
physical reality or not.<br>
<br>
Mental Defectives are those who cannot differentiate between REAL
REALITY<br>
which always contains VIRTUAL REALITY, and VIRTUAL REALITY which can
never<br>
contain REAL REALITY, only represent it, since it is itself NOT reality.<br>
Just as the map is not the territory, nor the menu the meal.<br>
<br>
VR can be used to help the blind see more REALITY, but must never be
allowed<br>
to blind those who can already see it, which is precisely why we cannot

they can NOT EVER be secured PERIOD, before you even start, whether you

as there is no pot of gold at the end of rainbows, BY DEFINITION, a

This is because EVERY E-voting scheme REQUIRES TRUST.<br>

There however is a way where NO ONE &amp; NO THING need be trusted, and
this my<br>
friend is the NO-TEK solution that has been obfuscated for at least
10,000<br>
years precisely because it GUARANTEES a fair vote every single time,<br>
something that Tyrants just cannot allow to be understood because it
would<br>
necessarily mean they do not get to be in power.<br>

given the same question will give different answers, besides the whole

is flawed, and of course once you accept the flawed basis everything
else is<br>
"acceptable" to the weak minded.<br>

What type of work have you done SS that allows you to so cavalierly
treat<br>

2. Everyone in the counting room @ end of day can see how many REAL

Votes<br>
that are not claimed are wiped from the board until the number of
people and<br>
votes match. This is REAL democracy, requiring JUST ONE day of REAL<br>
participation.<br>

is<br>
pure, each county is pure and so on. Since you cannot steal the

<br>
Dawson asked the question quite straightforwardly, Bismark's answer
assumes<br>
we are idiots, as it does not address the "DOUBLE SET of BOOKs" nor the
"END<br>
RUN" gambits, either of which could give individuals answers they expect<br>
while still stealing the election. <br>
<br>
High Quality Fraud systems can even reverse engineer paper trails real
time<br>
to fit desired outcomes without even "trusted" observers noticing to
satisfy<br>
all observations, all EXCEPT the all in one view afforded per precinct
as it<br>
unfolds @ end of day with all voters present per this:
<a href="http://goo.gl/mq3zh">http://GOO.GL/mq3zh</a><br>
hence your need use it and to abandon all other methods. <br>

A B C D vote for X. A has no clue who B C or D are or how they have

<br>
THUS the ONLY way to prevent this, is actually very simple. A B C D from<br>
precinct Z reconvene at days end TOGETHER to verify their votes have

counted correctly.<br>

All precinct Z votes &amp; deli codes are displayed on a giant board

as
reporting
is<br>
the only part that matters, as it is the summation of everything else
that<br>
took place before it, and the only part that must be rigged to steal the<br>
election, thus we cannot depend on anything between us and the
reporting of<br>
the results, as everything else you have described is just a way to
gain the<br>
"confidence" of the voters, i.e. a "process" was used, but WE must be
the<br>
process from start to finish in each precinct via this simple NO-TEK<br>

ZERO is ZERO, anything else is not. <br>
<br>
This system must have ZERO trust to be itself trusted, ZERO....<br>
<br>
There must be ZERO hiding places in a system that determines something
as<br>
sacred as who our leaders are. They must not be allowed to hijack it as
you<br>
say. <br>

The this is as good as it gets gambit will not do either.<br>

Nov 8 2010: If we cannot be assured the system is fair, we only have the<br>
APPEARANCE of Democracy, which is anything but democracy. <br>
<br>
Bismark's system, and all E-systems, are FRAUDULENT straight out of the<br>
gate, and all you fools can do is discuss the arrangement of the
furniture<br>
in a fraudulent system.<br>
<br>
The people cannot trust anyone within their ranks, especially those who<br>
believe they are somehow above the "regular" people, this is a
fundamental<br>
concept of TRUTH.<br>
<br>
Thus we can have no system that hides any aspect of itself from anyone
at<br>
anytime, it must be visible in its entirety all at once, every precinct
at a<br>
time. <br>
<br>
If you morons really cannot understand this low tech fail safe approach
you<br>
are not qualified to protect anyone from anything, nor even your
dangerously<br>
silly selves and must be protected by those who do understand the
dangers of<br>
putting idiots in charge of anything, especially determining who our

are.<br>

they<br>
are smart... <br>
<br>
Yes any of you who entertain any sort of electronic voting system
whatsoever<br>
are all fools, as you do not understand first principles. <br>
<br>
There is no way to secure a system meant to tabulate the decisions of a<br>
group of people unless that group of people does it themselves all at
once<br>
on the spot, which of course is possible. <br>
<br>
No different than other virtual problems like gold coin versus paper
money.<br>
Same thing.<br>
<br>
First principle, you cannot trust anyone, especially those to whom you
have<br>
given yours and your ability to take it back when they violate it.<br>

Nov 2 2010: BOGUS: The only way to verify a physical vote is to have<br>
everyone who voted to view a single physical board per precinct with
all the<br>
votes cast displayed with a code next to each vote that each voter will
be<br>
able to view and acknowledge, or deny, that indeed that is how they
voted by<br>
matching it with the code they received when they cast their votes,
without<br>
of course revealing who they voted for, yes all of them must be present
at<br>
the same time, with no one dissenting, which can be done on a precinct
by<br>
precinct basis. There can be no electronics involved of any kind, none.<br>
There simply is no other way, and yes it is as simple as this.<br>
<br>
As for logistics, voting is that important, that it must be an entire
day<br>
off, that is the least we can do for something this important, alas they<br>
know this too, and do not really what to hear what you really think.<br>

Mar 27 2008: Jose Tavares: <br>
<br>
Thanks for your cogent description of religion generically... <br>
<br>
I would like to agree with you on the generics and also delve deeper
into<br>
the historical application of these generics as described below in my
post,<br>
wherein it was discussed how the Roman Empire attempted to apply your<br>
generics in the destruction of the only civilization to not bend its
knee to<br>
the Roman Juggernaut, and that in order to destroy Judaism, they<br>
parasitically attached a new religion to Judaism, forged it to appear
as a<br>
natural progression from it, via the Jesus Story, and that as a result,
they<br>
not only attempted to steal the power of Judaism, they also created a
huge<br>
force that produced billions of robotic humans to toil endlessly
generation<br>
after generation, essentially throwaway disposable people, and that as a<br>
result, we are delaying the advent of REAL LIFE EVERLASTING BEFORE
DEATH,<br>
via the Emancipation of Humanity from the Machinery of Economy through
the<br>
REAL ROBOTIC WAGELESS ECONOMY - http://RoboEco.com/ttenned<br>
<br>
And that moreover, the bullies who have coasted on this easy system of<br>
domination of humans will never stop unless we intelligently
transition, and<br>
ironically are preventing themselves from living forever BEFORE death,<br>
because of their addiction to the ill gotten easy spoils of the current<br>
system.<br>

&nbsp;A comment on Talk: Richard Dawkins on militant atheism<br>
Mar 27 2008: Just because most religions are false does not mean all<br>
are..........<br>
<br>
You existence proves everything you need to know, i.e. why is there not
just<br>
nothing ?<br>
<br>
You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
terms<br>
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether
it is<br>
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.<br>
<br>
That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go
back<br>
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
should be<br>
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The<br>
Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first, it
goes<br>
without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue<br>
with as not being virtuous.<br>
<br>
This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so
we<br>
are not taken for fools forever.<br>
<br>
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
highest<br>
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what
do you<br>
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?<br>
<br>
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
exploitation of<br>
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating "holding<br>
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a<br>
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still people<br>
"naively" "debate" it.<br>
<br>
What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?<br>
<br>
Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity is
an<br>
effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
catatonic/robotic<br>
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
people<br>
get on with ruling in "reality" ?<br>
<br>
If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a<br>
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion
that<br>
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
bend the<br>
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via
the<br>
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
dogma<br>
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
conquering<br>
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
bully's<br>
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending<br>
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?<br>
<br>
Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply<br>
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.<br>
<br>
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,
what do<br>
you expect for its adherents ?<br>
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.<br>
<br>
This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also
seems<br>
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.<br>
<br>
Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is very<br>
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman Empire,<br>
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?<br>
<br>
If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the
same<br>
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations
sacrifice,<br>
correct ?<br>
<br>
Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense ?<br>
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?<br>
<br>
Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?<br>
<br>
Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on the<br>
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my
assertions<br>
false, they must be true !???<br>
<br>
Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know
the<br>
context.<br>
<br>
The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and<br>
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?<br>
<br>
Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for
intentional<br>
sins in any case. Study friend, study.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other<br>
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and
Eve's<br>
sins.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never<br>
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for
their<br>
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not
questioning the<br>
framework itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not<br>
surprisingly, exploitative.<br>
<br>
Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way
around,<br>
agreed ?<br>
<br>
We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we
really<br>
get that upset about them ripping people off ?<br>
<br>
We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep in<br>
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT
Christians,<br>
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we
know<br>
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built
on<br>
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered
Jewish<br>
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today<br>
notwithstanding.<br>
<br>
In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like an<br>
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
Rabbi<br>
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures<br>
<br>
We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject<br>
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews
for<br>
Jesus FrankenFaith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers
as<br>
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole
deal,<br>
and who is there to argue with you ?<br>
<br>
If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.<br>
<br>
At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the<br>
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying to<br>
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short,
and<br>
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
Scriptures<br>
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for<br>
starters.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's
sins<br>
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!<br>
<br>
Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of
accounting and<br>
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of
truth<br>
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,<br>
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be<br>
manipulated at will.<br>
<br>
Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
millions of<br>
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the<br>
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age
of<br>
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once
and<br>
for ALL !!!<br>

effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
catatonic/robotic<br>
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
people<br>
get on with ruling in "reality" ?<br>
<br>
If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a<br>
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion
that<br>
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
bend the<br>
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via
the<br>
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
dogma<br>
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
conquering<br>
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
bully's<br>
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending<br>
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?<br>
<br>
Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply<br>
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.<br>
<br>
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,
what do<br>
you expect for its adherents ?<br>
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.<br>
Julia, thank you for being studious and interested in the truth in all<br>
things.<br>
<br>
This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also
seems<br>
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.<br>
<br>
Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is very<br>
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman Empire,<br>
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?<br>
<br>
If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the
same<br>
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations
sacrifice,<br>
correct ?<br>
<br>
Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense ?<br>
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?<br>
<br>
Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?<br>
<br>
Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on the<br>
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my
assertions<br>
false, they must be true !???<br>
<br>
Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know
the<br>
context.<br>
<br>
The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and<br>
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?<br>
<br>
Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for
intentional<br>
sins in any case. Study friend, study.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other<br>
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and
Eve's<br>
sins.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never<br>
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for
their<br>
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not
questioning the<br>
framework itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not<br>
surprisingly, exploitative.<br>
<br>
Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way
around,<br>
agreed ?<br>
<br>
We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we
really<br>
get that upset about them ripping people off ?<br>
<br>
We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep in<br>
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT
Christians,<br>
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we
know<br>
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built
on<br>
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered
Jewish<br>
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today<br>
notwithstanding.<br>
<br>
In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like an<br>
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
Rabbi<br>
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures<br>
<br>
We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject<br>
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews
for<br>
Jesus FrankenFaith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers
as<br>
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole
deal,<br>
and who is there to argue with you ?<br>
<br>
If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.<br>
<br>
At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the<br>
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying to<br>
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short,
and<br>
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
Scriptures<br>
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for<br>
starters.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's
sins<br>
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!<br>
<br>
Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of
accounting and<br>
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of
truth<br>
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,<br>
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be<br>
manipulated at will.<br>
<br>
Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
millions of<br>
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the<br>
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age
of<br>
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once
and<br>
for ALL !!!<br>

&nbsp;A comment on Talk: Rick Warren on a life of purpose<br>
Mar 27 2008: Rick:<br>
<br>
LET OUR PEOPLE GO !!!<br>
<br>
Instead of focusing only on what is good for one group, but instead on
a way<br>
where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The Inevitable Robotic
Wageless<br>
Economy", more on that below, but first, it goes without saying that the<br>
attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue with as not being
virtuous.<br>
<br>
This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so
we<br>
are not taken for fools forever.<br>
<br>
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
highest<br>
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what
do you<br>
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?<br>
<br>
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
exploitation of<br>
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating "holding<br>
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a<br>
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still people<br>
"naively" "debate" it.<br>
<br>
What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?<br>
<br>

Mar 26 2008: Dan:<br>
<br>
You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
terms<br>
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether
it is<br>
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.<br>
<br>
That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go
back<br>
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
should be<br>
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The<br>
