A comment on Talk: Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of China
35 minutes ago: .
In fairness to Martin, he may not be
able to see the new economic 
paradigm that WE-R©

That is just how big it is, i.e. it really 
does solve all issues, for everyone, 
yet it is so simple, i.e. as the truth 
always is.	

We encourage Martin to study it
here at his leisure, and earliest
convenience:

Let real ROBOTS be ROBOTS,
and humans be beings.

Human beings were born to be.

All humans are worthy, yes all even
the perps but only under a system
that allows ALL to EXPRESS their
FREE-WILL 100% AND safely,
no matter what. Yes it is possible
without losers, as defined when we
said ALL.
A comment on Talk: Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of China
1 hour ago: .
Besides Martin's gross jingoistic generalizations, 
sweeping over simplifications, heavy reliance on
false dichotomies, assumptions that he knows 
the Chinese better than Westerners, despite being
a Westerner himself, is laughable.

His assumptions that anyone is "puzzled" is puzzling.

Martin is a straight-up con-artist working for those who
have molded Chinese people into their own obedient 
ROBOTS, whether they realize it or not: is now trying to 
play them off his own people with complete treachery which
is not surprising when you consider what his type has done
to the Chinese people over the centuries, just read here:

http://goo.gl/eSIF

"New" Kind of paradigm ?

WE-R© the new model 
WE-R© Wageless Economy - Robotic©

Leave this world ALIVE... as WE-R©

So WE-R© clearly the new paradigm
not whatever Martin his secret mason
brethren imagine.

Our system works for all, unlike their 
way where all work for them !!!

The truth behind why China's people 
are being propagandized against the
west, a truth that you hopefully had 
nothing to do with, yet you need to KNOW
about, to avoid being propagandized
yourself, and so both peoples, both 
westerners and easterners can see 
who the REAL COMMON ENEMY IS.

So this COMMON enemy the world 
over can come to its senses sooner
rather than later.

4 days ago: .
Hi Gregory,

Your goals are noble, and ones we share wholeheartedly.

However you are 100% WRONG, that David's "system",
or any ELECTRONIC voting system for that matter, would
do anything but provide an impenetrable "deceit monopoly" 
to a new "priest-class" that the entire world would be
at the mercy of, enforced by a police state that you 
supposedly "voted" in !!!

What is more, it would not even be 
detectable, as the verification
process is such that mere mortals 
would be convinced of its"veracity" 
via techno-chauvinsim, and "expert" 
interpretation.

These "experts" would also be deceived 
by the "high-priests" who "train" them.

Thus the absolutely most important thing 
for you to do Gregory, is to share this
truth as far and wide as you can 
as soon as you can.

HOWEVER, there is a sure fire 
NO-TECH solution that REALLY
works, & EVERYONE can 
agree is 100% FAIL-SAFE 
EVERYTIME.

Please read about it here friend:

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Jan 10 2011: Furthermore, there can be no place for trust in the election
process precisely because the whole idea is to insure that the will of the
voters is expressed and that no one be able to subvert that process,
including those to whom trust is currently placed, who could then violate
that trust to perpetuate their vaunted position of being trusted in the
first place without being detected with unsecureable election methods such
as all EVS inherently are.

Once the people's will has been expressed, THOSE who won the election NOW
have their trust, but not before.

Hence it is only through a system that eliminates the need for trust
completely during the sacred election process itself that we can be assured
of this.

here is that system: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Be well Ngan, and thanks for your participation in the discuss !!!

Jan 10 2011: Hi ngan, as soon as one mentions the words "officers", and
"have to show", all bets are off and anonymity is destroyed.

The FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system has no "officers": we must not have two levels
of people, because when we do, we always end up with abuse, guaranteed !!!

See how Mikko's excellent question is deftly handled
under FAIL-SAFE PROCEDURE DEFINED, section 5.7
here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Also, each vote is sacred, big numbers mean nothing, & must not be allowed
to be the basis for hiding things in big numbers. Besides, no EVS can insure
anyone their vote was corrected either, simply not possible, as it still
requires "faith" & "trust" in others. As soon as you admit that, no matter
how many processes you wrap verification in, you still do not have
verification, only the possibility of it, and then the process becomes
social engineering, to make people beLIEve it is official because
"officials" were involved.

Jan 10 2011: .
Excellent question Mikko

Under our FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system, this is handled during the anonymous yet
PUBLIC verification stage PER precinct and just that vote is corrected, no
need to redo the entire election. 

please review here: goo.gl/mq3zh

This is not possible in any electronic voting system, simply not possible
because it could still be wrong and the voter would only have received lip
service. 

And you are correct, liars can ruin many things, which is precisely why we
need a process to give the voters a chance to keep them out of office.

Yes indeed it is CV. 

Here is the best way to do that which you describe: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

It is important to note that David's system is naive, best case scenario.

It appeals to techno-chauvinists, and is very dangerous in reality as it
creates a false sense of "security", yet in reality can only be "secured"
with a Police State to back it up, which makes voting meaningless anyway.

Here is the system that does work however:

Hi Naiem, 

You hit the nail through the board, bravo.

THERE IS NO WAY to PREVENT THIS except this way: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

In fact, electronically, real time, they can fake only the exact number they
need to, the needle in the hay-stack gambit, to get the desired outcome WITH
plausible deniability, then use all the fancy schmancy "cybersecurity" mumbo
jumbo to "certify" it, and once done, there is no way to prove they did it,
pretty scary huh, yet it is also true, they will then have a monopoly on
deceit, only "they" will be able to cheat, and no one can even prove that
they have, UNLESS we use this method which prevents its possibility
altogether straight out the gate, WITHOUT a POLICE STATE to "enforce it":

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 22 2010: Combine this with the FACT that since this algorithm is & must
be published completely to be trusted at all, in the nevertheless always
untrustworthy Cybernetic domain, it is trivial to know the product PQ has
only TWO factors, i.e. P & Q as primes dictate ! 

Even worse, even though there is no largest prime, they do thin out VERY
quickly as you go up, thus factoring them becomes a trivial matter even with
GARGANTUAN P & Q, as they trail off in density inversely EXPONENTIALLY to
the natural log N, base e as N increases.

So we have a VERY WELL KNOWN FIXED NON-MOVING TARGET, i.e. the primes, which
have been studied & PUBLISHED since the earliest recorded times, whose
density drops off dramatically as you go up, THUS PK is ALL MYSTIQUE &
BLUFF, as so few really have taken even the minimum amount of time to
understand it as we have laid it out above: each simply taking OTHERS word
for it, not realizing that they haven't looked into it either, FOOLS.

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 22 2010: .
x = MMI of a (mod y) simply means what integer value of x will make ax%y=1

In other words, a times what integer when divided by y gives remainder=1?

This x is the MMI of a (mod y), yes it is that simple.

Thus we have d=MMI 3 (mod 4) = 7 because (3*7)/4=5 with remainder 1

Our message, m=8

We encrypt m giving us cyphertext c=m^e % N = 8*8*8 % 10 = 512 % 10 = 2

Thus P=2, Q=5, N=10, Z=4, e=3, d=7, m=8, c=2

Now lets decrypt it and see if it is what we started with.

m=c^d % N = 2^7 % 10 = 128 % 10 = 8 !!!! It works, and yes it is that
simple.

NOW, lets see, the only thing we need to know is P & Q and we get it all.
We know PxQ, just not P & Q themselves. We also know e !!!!

Thus we need only factor PxQ, how hard can that be, even if P&Q are huge,
how bout not hard at all !!!

WHY ? 

Well lets start off with the fact that the primes are FIXED never change,
and we know TONS of them already.

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 22 2010: But as you appear to want to understand how cryptography works,
please read the following, it is very simple as all truth is, and is very
important for the individual to understand and use with other individuals as
needed to protect the individual from the State as the State is the biggest
mass murderer of all time when armed with technologies meant to serve only
the individual, hope this fine yet most importatnt distinction is clear to
everyone. 

It is similar to all classic philisophical razor edge distinctions, e.g.
what is appropriate in one context, and most beautiful etc, can be
completely horrid & deadly in another, same exact thing, just wrong context,
catastrophic outcome.

Now please how easy it is to understand and thus break the following:

Public Key Encryption EXACTLY as it is:

P=2, Q=5 are Prime
N=PQ=10
Z=(P-1)(Q-1)=4
encryption key e=3, can be anything coprime to Z
Public Key is N & e
Private Key d is MMI = modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod Z)

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 22 2010: .
A. Cybernetic Voting cannot be secured without a Police State, under Police
State Dissent is impossible, thus reason enough not to use it.
B. Encryption that is not published completely cannot be trusted, that which
is, can be broken, no matter what anyone tells you as we will demonstrate
below, thus it too cannot be trusted since it can be broken.
C. The very people who can make complicated encryption are also smart enough
to trick YOU when you beLIEve a word they say.
D. Do not take anyone's word for item C, just know that it is true. 
E. Virtual must remain the servant of Real
F. Real cannot be allowed to be changed by virtual, this would be akin to a
shadow controlling the one who cast it.
G. Just remember that the virtual in this case will be the shadow not of the
the voters, but of the one you cannot see yet does exist and must remain
encrypted, in its crypt to be able to operate, and thus must be forbidden by
the living from entering our physical realm or suffer the same fate.

Nov 22 2010: .
Admire everyone's desire to understand.

Just remember though that all bets are off once you cross the
cybernetic-threshhold which completely disconnects you from the real
physical world and needn't correspond in any way to it. That is rule number
1. You really need not read the rest of this message in fact.

Hope this point is clear, and if not please ask.

Also let us not lose sight of the simple task we are trying to complete
here.

It is not as though we are trying to predict the weather 40 days from now,
we are after all only trying to determine who we voted for, who REALLY won,
an event which actually took place in non-cyber real reality, totals that
can be completely obscured without anyone being able to prove it in
cyberspace, no matter what!

Yet what did happen on election day is known, it is an event we control and
even invited everyone to participate in for crying out loud.

Powerful Catch-22s prevent those who understand from using Cybernetics in
Elections in anyway:

Nov 18 2010: You got it Sameer, there is no way in Cybernetic Voting to know
anything at all, that is the whole point. 

No matter how much "process" and "verification" is thrown at you to make you
feel good about "it", after all is said and done, it is just lipstick on a
pig, and all the Kings Horse's and All The Kings Men, can do nothing to put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

Ironically it is Cybernetics as embodied in the Internet that has broken
their egg, and Cybernetic Voting is their vain & most desperate attempt to
put it back together again !!!

Cybernetics must serve humanity, not enslave it.

Simply tricking "tRUSTed" signatories into beLIEving that just because their

couldn't exist yet does, is merely a DEADLY MONOPOLIZATION of DECEIT!!

The key point is that Computers are appropriate in many applications, but
not all, due to their ability to create cyberspace, that place where no
human can go, and the ease within which anything can be made to be "true"
via "say so".

Computers give us the fantastic ability to visualize/hypothesize ANYTHING,
thus are the very weakness that prohibit their use in ELECTIONS

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 17 2010: Great question Sameer, they cannot, it is not possible, you can
only see that your vote is correct. And what if it isn't, do you really
think they will change everything just for you ? Get real. How do they know
you are not lying and just trying to cause trouble ? 

This is all bluff and feel good process obfuscation. 

They can work it backwards, i.e. see how everyone voted to see just how much
fraud is required to get their desired results.

Then mathematically determine just how much fraud is necessary, then add in
only the fake votes necessary, spread it across as many precincts as
necessary to avoid attention, targeting precincts based on demographics that
provide plausible deniabilty. 

Then using this cooked result, run it through all the "process", and voila
"irrefutable" proof.


Yet Sameer, as you may have suspected, there is a way, and it is VERY simple
and requires no computers, in fact prohibits their use ab initio:

Here is that way: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 17 2010: Hi Richard, remember, all this process everyone is signing off
on almost no one understands yet claim they do.

But those of us who do, know it is all bluff & obfuscation.

Your due diligence is rare Richard, most everyone is relying on 'experts'
who have not looked into it either. Big Lies work so well because no one
believes anyone could be so audacious. Look at how long WTC 7 has remained
hidden: even now people doubt it, even with Geraldo changing his mind no
less. http://goo.gl/tHzS

The end run with reverse engineering of desired results using the very
protocols that gained your confidence would make such results "irrefutable",
yet completely fabricated with everyone seeing exactly what they need to
see, yet the results nevertheless being fabricated because unless you get
EVERYONE to SEE and CONFIRM EVERYTHING @ same time PHYSICALLY, it is but a
shell game that such sophisticated mathematics can certainly pull off.

Remember all truth is simple, only lies are complicated.

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 17 2010: We need look no deeper than if even one bit is off, an entire
election can be destroyed. Of course they are bluffing so it's moot.

Today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers among other
techniques.

What do we know about prime numbers ?

Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are fascinating to
be sure.

Yet there is one very important aspect related to prime numbers that
ironically makes their use in cryptography inappropriate: thus renders
cryptography itself as the realm of bluffers extraordinaire, con-artists,
chiseler flimflammers rivaling televangelists & fiatists in every way: their
retinue of mesmerized true-believers fully entranced.

So what is it about prime numbers that makes this so ?

It is the fact they are FIXED, KNOWN even PUBLISHED sufficiently !!

Hello ?

Nov 16 2010: Hi Stephen, cant you see that even if you can verify how you
voted, that it is meaningless if the results do not reflect that. There is
no way for you or anyone else to determine that unless YOU ALL SEE
EVERYTHING @ SAME TIME in PHYSICAL REALITY as this system
http://goo.gl/mq3zh provides the ability to do WITHOUT computers of any
kind. 

Anything else is a shell game.

Besides, lets say you did object, what would they do, change your vote ? Get
real. Run as far and as fast as you can away from this "idea" only after you
have warned others my friend. 

Please read everything else here my friend. Many others were excited at
first too, but this is a very dangerous idea as it WILL lead to the end of
physical expression of free will of the meek, innocent & wise who would have
nothing to do with such tomfoolery precisely as the wise know where this
leads.

Nov 16 2010: Herein lies the paradox, no matter what cryptographic technique
employed, to be trusted it must be published, if published it can be
understood & thus broken, hence not trusted. Whatever can be known cannot be
hidden.

Philosophically, the reason this is true is because TRUTH's very nature is
to be known, NOT hidden.

Like a beach ball resists being held underwater.

Only lies must be hidden from the truth which renders them what they are,
lies.

Never mind the SELF-EVIDENT fact that Cyberspace is the place no human can
go with their body, and thus is the place where PHYSICAL ELECTIONS CANNOT
take place as virtual may only serve physical, never determine it. Can
shadow control body?

Voters exist in physical reality with physical needs that elections are
meant to serve.

Cyberspace: place where anything can happen is NOT bound in anyway to
physical reality, or what really happened: same as beLIEf.

These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to visualize
and hypothesize ANYTHING, thus are the very weakness that prohibit their use
in the determination of PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP especially since it is not
required to do so per this solution: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 16 2010: Vikas, theoretically it is indeed intriguing but cannot EVER be
used in the real world.

Cyberspace is that place no human can go with their body. Where any thing
can be made true with no physical connection to reality.

The end run with reverse engineering of desired results using the very
protocols that gained your confidence would make such results "irrefutable",
yet completely fabricated with everyone seeing exactly what they need to
see, yet the results nevertheless being fabricated because unless you get
EVERYONE to SEE and CONFIRM EVERYTHING @ same time PHYSICALLY, it is but a
shell game that such sophisticated mathematics can certainly pull off.

Thus the only system that is 100% FAIL-SAFE bans the use of computers
altogether, precisely because they are A. not necessary, and B. because
their use necessarily PRECLUDES the ability to secure it due to cybernetic
"SAY SO" they bring to the table.

Here is the system that can do it: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 16 2010: See these faux elites grew lazy, they do not have to understand
how anything really works when they can just bully those who do to do it for
them. Make it so.

There are of course REAL-ELITES, like ERIC BLAIR who deserve the name as
they only think good thoughts, speak good words and do good deeds.

Yet faux elite tyrants who have farmed humans for 10,000 years at least are
threatened by the Internet and wish to use it not to free the slaves, but to
ELIMINATE them now that REAL ROBOTS are finally a reality.

99.9999% of the population are slaves.

So WE must use the internet to free everyone, including them from their
addiction to lies and wicked ways.

We can do it, and everyone wins, when REAL ROBOTS replace the human robots,
and no one gets hurt. 

We do not need to kill the slaves, we need to free them, even the tyrants
are slaves to their own LIES !!!

Groups only exist via declaration.

As such groups can be destroyed without destroying individuals.

Individuals are thus sacred and all rights begin and end with them.

Including the right to a VOTE that counts: http://goo.gl/mq3zh


SB, above you say: "With the data available on the internet at every step,
there's no space for a high authority to muck with the results in secrecy. "

You know though that anyone can be made to see precisely whatever is
intended for them to see via the internet down to the session layer, and
there is NO WAY to prevent that, and any attempts to do so would necessarily
involve a POLICE STATE that would make dissent impossible ab initio ?

Nov 16 2010: For those who know, Cryptography is all bluff in reality. 

It shrewdly exploits an asymmetry in awareness of legitimate mathematical
principles, to foist a fraud on even those who merely BELIEVE they are
cryptographic 'experts', being named such by others they have not pondered
deeply enough that those who have named them such are themselves not aware
of this self-deception in their ranks, or that those who do know this choose
not to tell them precisely because it achieves the desired result of THEIR
BLUFF !!

Which is to create a faith-based-religion that asserts that truth can be
hidden for a long enough time to prevent others from accessing it in a
timely manner, which assumes incorrectly the existence of 'time' as a
physical quality.

This is the crux.

As time does not exist in physical reality, there is no way to use it to
your advantage WITHOUT deception.

Like voodoo, crypto works only on those who believe it does.

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 16 2010: S B: Above you state "Nifty puzzles come out of this field".
Very true.

Cryptography's purpose is to protect the individual from state: never used
by 'state' against the individual, thus a moratorium, out right ban against
state use of cryptography & cybernetic ELECTIONS must take place.

The only place for computers in government is EVERYTHING else, just not
ELECTIONS & just not cryptography, as it only serves to enable those who
commandeer state to exert their will in secret over those who have not &
would never even be interested in doing so, thus it must be banned from
state altogether so we do not have to wonder whether it has been subverted
or not.

Even with such a ban there would be as there is now, a shadow state that
does manipulate, but at least this way it will be VERY clear they are doing
so outside the law. We must keep the lines of demarcation clear & we can, or
only the crooks will have free-will.

State is the biggest mass murderer.

Nov 15 2010: .
Truth is obvious to the pure of heart.

Truth

There are many partial-truths. There is a partial-truth for every being and
for every particle of the universe --for each one reflects everything else
in a different way.

To seek truth means more than finding your own partial-truth. It means
finding THE truth that works for you and for the other guy, for now and
forever, in this place and everywhere, for the body and for the soul, for
the sage and for the young, innocent child. 

The higher the partial-truth, the fewer boundaries it knows.

Truth travels the world over, because wherever it goes, it is at least
partially rejected and must move on.

Partial-truth is always a FOUL LIE, for every lie is a sentence that has
true words in it.

Nov 15 2010: Only self-evident truth is true, is very simple to understand.

All truth is obvious and simple.

Only lies are complex and require long winded explanations to "understand".
Many agree just because they do not want to appear stupid, when most times
that is who really is.

Lies have to be complex because neither exist in reality where everything is
simple.

Lies must be complex to hide the fact they are lies to as many as they can
get away with.

If truth is not obvious to you, it means you have disconnected from
yourself, and are confusing things which do not belong together, and it
becomes a mystery to you.

Complex does not exist in reality, only simplex relationships.

Just because there are many simplex relationships does not mean that
complexity exists anymore than just because there are many individuals that
groups exist.

All so called "complex" systems can always be reduced into a set of simplex
relationships none of which contains any mystery at all.

Nov 15 2010: Sir Richard, above you mention in so many words that you will
conclude nothing until a so called "expert" says so. That is what we call
"say so".

As if others should do your work for you. Today more than ever, although it
was always true, WE OURSELVES MUST and CAN BE the "expert".

Dependency on others is weak & very dangerous.

It brings out contempt in those who do know especially when they are
expected to work for the lazy who do not even bother to see the obvious.

Only self-evident truth is true. Same with self-deception, it is always the
self that deceives the self, no one else can deceive you.

If they can know, you can know unless you are admitting some mental defect
of course.

If someone can know, you can know too, or that which is claimed to be known
in fact cannot be. Alas, the precisely the point.

Until and unless you reduce everything to that simple logic, you will
forever tRUST and be betrayed by those you thought were doing work you could
have done yourself.

Nov 15 2010: Herein lies the paradox, no matter what cryptographic technique
employed, to be trusted it must be published, if published it can be
understood & thus broken, hence not trusted. Whatever can be known cannot be
hidden.

Philosophically, the reason this is true is because TRUTH's very nature is
to be known, NOT hidden.

Like a beach ball resists being held underwater.

Only lies must be hidden from the truth which renders them what they are,
lies.

Never mind the SELF-EVIDENT fact that Cyberspace is the place no human can
go with their body, and thus is the place where PHYSICAL ELECTIONS CANNOT
take place as virtual may only serve physical, never determine it. Can
shadow control body?

Voters exist in physical reality with physical needs that elections are
meant to serve.

Cyberspace: place where anything can happen is NOT bound in anyway to
physical reality, or what really happened: same as beLIEf.

Nov 15 2010: To develop this point further, we need look no deeper than if
even one bit is off, an entire election can be destroyed. Of course they are
bluffing so it's moot.

Also, today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers.

What do we know about prime numbers ?

Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are fascinating to
be sure.

Yet there is one very important aspect related to prime numbers that
ironically makes their use in cryptography inappropriate: thus renders
cryptography itself as the realm of bluffers extraordinaire, con-artists,
chiseler flimflammers rivaling televangelists & fiatists in every way: their
retinue of mesmerized true-believers fully entranced.

So what is it about prime numbers that makes this so ?

It is the fact they are FIXED, KNOWN even PUBLISHED sufficiently !!

Hello ?

Just because you are not familiar with them does not mean the very people
you are trusting are not. Yet you can KNOW them too: then see the majesty of

Nov 15 2010: As for why Sirs David & Steve cannot provide specifics or even
a description in their OWN words of how their system works is unfathomable
perhaps, one can only wonder.

As Simson Garfinkel states in his classic "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy" page
53, and others have in similar fashion elsewhere:

"Many companies claim that their programs use proprietary encryption
algorithms. These companies assure you that their algorithms are secure but
nevertheless won't reveal the algorithms that their products use. Ask them
for details & you're likely to be told, 'If we told you then the program
would be less secure.' You should avoid these programs; usually, the
companies don't reveal their encryption systems because they are embarrassed
by how easily the systems are broken. Remember, if the security of the
system is really depended on the secrecy of the algorithm, a determined
attacker would merely have to get a copy"

them, that is their fault, no one else's. 

Of course they could not answer the questions truthfully so they remained
silent which is better than lying but not as good as coming clean & admit a
lemon is a lemon, THAT ALL would agree is the purpose of discourse, as

How so ?

Think of a really nice safe. Where ever it is, it can be removed & broken

And that is a PHYSICAL system

Cybernetic systems are even LESS secure, as they are not even physical, are
purely what ever their creators say they are

It is a box, with nothing in it, but whatever "they" say

This "they" must be all of us when it comes to ELECTIONS, as no one can nor

Thus we must face the TRUTH meant to protect us all, that this is the only

ERIC BLAIR a TRUE British Elite unlike others, whose pen name was George
Orwell, an MI5 insider, born in India to a British Military Intelligence
family there on behalf of the Queen, was murdered for exposing inside plans,

DOUBLETHINK

The ability to hold at least two contradictory ideas in the mind without
experiencing cognitive dissonance.

DOUBLESPEAK

The ability to speak or write two or more contradictory ideas without the
speaker or writer being consciously aware of the contradiction. Doublespeak
may be, and probably is, consciously used to deceive.

It is very dangerous to witness DOUBLE SPEAK, and NOT SPEAK up about it.

Nov 14 2010: Greg Greg Greg, we ELECT LEADERS, we do not decide who lives or
dies or who can speak.

See democracy is based upon a bedrock of individual inalienable rights that
even democracy cannot infringe. Those rights begin and END with the
in-divid-ual. 

Only once those are secure can issues ABOVE those be determined via
democracy, and those determinations may not reach back down into the bedrock
of inalienable rights to impact them in any way, hence their being named
inalienable, inviolable.

If the individual is considered sacred and protected, all groups will be as
well, as groups are all made up of individuals, so there is no such thing as
group rights, as all such notions always diminish the rights of the
individual.

Hence the need to protect the sanctity of ELECTIONS, and prohibit FOREVER
the use of cybernetic technology in them for what should be to everyone

Nov 14 2010: Cryptography is a great thing, just not for Elections, no not
ever.

CRYPTOGRAPHY is to protect the individual from the mob, not the other way
around.

The real and only purpose of cryptography is to permit individuals to
communicate with each other with 100% privacy, and NOT for governments and
corporations to exercise tyranny over the individual, isolating it,
atomizing it, separating it from its own life, from itself and others to
enslave it, while making it believe it is free via mass mind control,
nefarious protocols, pharmacopoeia and most of all FAKE ELECTIONS. 

Cryptography's true purpose is to free us from each other on demand, when we
mutually choose or not, to enhance individuals ability to decide their own
fate, via 100% Privacy when desired with whom we choose to share it, to
exercise 100 % Freewill without ever inhibiting anyone else's ability to do
the same as WE-R©, Plural of I AM

Nov 13 2010: Cryptographic systems are often the purview, terrain & work of
SPOOKS, the very type of people who can by definition NEVER be trusted with
anything, and MUST therefore be kept as far away from ELECTIONS as possible
it turns out. 

They are mutually exclusive in fact, fatally incompatible forever and ever,
so be it, so it is. 

We do however need white hat cryptographers to explain to others WHY
computers can NEVER be suitable for ELECTIONS, and other computer scientists
& roboticists to explain what computers ARE good for, i.e. hypothesizing,
extrapolating, visualizing scenarios, controlling robotic systems, but NEVER
in the sacred process of ELECTING LEADERS, NEVER. 

With Wageless Economy Robotic©, we MUST have a way of determining what
people want for the robots to produce it, so the ability to accurately
collect these wishes from the public is key. 

Soon elections will not be necessary, but until then it is vital they be

how make lies true, when in REAL REALITY, TRUTH is AUTHORITY & NOT the other

Along your excellent observation that it always ends up an "appeal to

system like the one being suggested and ALL others are so weak in reality
that in order to implement them an entire Military Command & Control Grid

Nov 13 2010: It appears that Sir David Bismark may be under the influence of
others, who isn't, in which case he is not completely responsible for his
participation in this charade perhaps. 

The point being that it is a charade, and the sooner he realizes it the
better, so he can salvage his good name and move on into building a REAL
system which must be along these lines http://goo.gl/mq3zh, not one that
will only be used to fully immerse most of humanity under an electronic
spell where EVS and this behemoth http://goo.gl/GN4D combine to eliminate
the ability of the meek to exercise free will, while its architects run away
with all that is good and right, which in the end is not right of course,
hence why we are here to alert others, and David of course, bless his soul.

Lest you or anyone else believe we are anti-technology, nothing could be
further from the truth as explained here: http://goo.gl/WcMWo where we
propose full robotization.

Thank you Sir Richard for raising this issue. Be well.

Nov 13 2010: Sir Richard, take your pick, they are either lying or
"learning", but after having watched David's youtube, am fairly sure David
is not intentionally deceiving, as far as that can be determined from
watching a video. He appears to be what is known as a true believer, when
all we are suggesting is that for something as serious as electing leaders,
that belief & faith is the last thing we should be relying on. It must be
KNOWLEDGE, without tRUST of any kind. KNOWLEDGE MUST be TRUE to be
KNOWLEDGE. The same is not true of beLIEf, hence it, like tRUST, must be
completely eliminated from systems where life and death are concerned.

Furthermore, there have been countless examples of priest classes of
depraved psycho-paths who have commandeered scribes to come up with
elaborate tales to justify the priest class' hidden masters' domination over
others, and today is no exception: http://goo.gl/GN4D

Was not even sure my posts were really being seen, THX for confirming at
least you see them

Nov 13 2010: Another great example is this recent BOMBSHELL from the

Nov 13 2010: SS confesses: "I don't think the necessity to defer to experts
can always be helped."

Balderdash. 

Simply raising the bar of complexity to exclude those who have not deceived
themselves into "believing" their "latest" religion is not an excuse to
create a new priest class of so called "experts".

Besides, this really is security thru obscurity, which means anyone who can
figure it out can get in, we need something real, not just N+1 layers of
complexity where N is the most recent, but not the latest hidden technique.

There is a reason these "papers" are behind paywalls and in weird formats
few use like Postscript etc when PDF or a web page would do, and no it is
NOT because they are valuable, it is all bluff & pretense, they have nothing
and they know it, they do not want others to know it, so they feign
sophistication from their faux-ivory tower.

It would be laughable if real lives & treasure were not at stake.

Nov 13 2010: SS, thanks for putting that together. But it must come together
at some point to be used. Just because its parts are hither and yon, it
cannot act as a whole in an algorithm unless it is reconstituted at least
once. Besides, even in transit from different locations, packet sniffing can
intercept the parts, or black bag teams can physically penetrate facilities
to get them, and entire elections can be destroyed if even one bit is off,
do you agree or not ? 

Cannot have it both ways SS, would you not have to agree to avoid lying ? 

THUS this is the only system that can work and has none of those
vulnerabilities due to simplicity everyone can appreciate and love:

Nov 13 2010: b) Not true. Perhaps you misunderstand. We are talking about
BEFORE they get the data, i.e. the data is first finagled, making it
irrelevant what bonafide processes they run on corrupt data. 

Besides, lets say someone does check their vote and lies and says it is not
right when it is, then what, i.e. this is a feature that has no real value,
all to make people feel better about being ripped off by a pig in lipstick ? 

The ONLY way is this way: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

It may not appear as interesting as the clever mathematical tricks in other
methods, but alas cleverness is not the criteria we use for such serious
endeavors, especially when such vapid cleverness DOES NOT and CANNOT ever
SECURE anything, other than the hypnotic trance it appears to have on
otherwise intelligent people being used by those who do understand &
salivate at the prospect of having such good servants implement their
decepto-control-grid for them without even realizing it !!!

Nov 13 2010: Furthermore, even if there is an adequate explanation for how
to create key shares and distribute them this only binds the participants
hands, not the one distributing the shares, besides in the end before we
even begin, and we must really only know this, it destroys everything ab
initio that follows our entrance into the dream world of cyberspace, it is
all operating within an insecure context, so it matters not if everything in
Alice in Wonderland is spelled correctly, it is just a false story, like
this:

One sunny day in the middle of the night, 
Two dead boys got up to fight.
Back to back they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot each other.
A Deaf Policeman heard the noise, 
came and killed the two dead boys.
If you do not believe this lie is true, 
ask the blind man, he saw it too.

Notice how there are no misspelled words, and the grammar is correct too,
yet the story is absurd, this also cannot be prevented in computers as you
SEE.

Nov 13 2010: Sir Richard, really admire your trying to get David to explain
it, & admire David's patience/bravery for attempting to defend the
indefensible: that once he realizes it, will be laughing at how absurd it
was to think it was possible to secure the insecurable. 

But until then it appears some will continue analyzing it as if this were
not the case which it most certainly is. Sir Richard, again great job on
sticking with it but we mustn't humor the absurd too long for risk of
becoming absurd ourselves.

David, please provide YOUR understanding of how DistKeyGen works. As with
any concept, it is possible to prove a point in less than 1000 characters. 

Like this: There is no largest prime number.
Proof.
1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.
2 Let p denote the largest prime number.
3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p
4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series
5 Thus q + 1 is either prime GT p, or has a prime factor GT p.

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 12 2010: The "protocol" for creating the key shares is controlled by
some nebulous, lurking unidentified entity, by clever design it turns out,
not surprisingly. 

It wishes it had not just been mentioned in fact, but is relying on most to
doubt its existence nevertheless, despite being told just now of its
existence and attempts to remain unnoticed.

Granted none of those who subject themselves to the protocol, but the
intentionally unnamed entity who subjects others to the "protocol" is not
subject by definition, and necessarily, they would know the whole key, there
is no way to prevent that. 

That information then becomes very valuable and creates a cadre of insiders
who know it but tell everyone else they do not. This is how shadow
governments are created. Same as it ever was.

We cannot and must not trust anyone as being more entitled to anything.

Instead we should only use this very simple method that acknowledges that we
are all equal as its very basis. http://goo.gl/mq3zh

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 12 2010: David, just watched your Key Shares youtube, excellent
presentation. It is clear that you believe what you say is true, i.e. that
you appear to be genuine, but you need to step back and ask yourself,
wouldn't it be even better to KNOW what you say is true ?

Granted all the "trusted" parties are lassoed into a system, but the
nebulous entity who is not, is still free to do whatever they want, i.e. the
controller of the algorithms, the custodian of the system itself is still
free to finagle behind the "process" which granted on the surface appears to
be very strong, giving a false sense of security, due to the ALWAYS possible
audacious END-RUN attack where you simply control the data itself that
everything else is run against, which would appear to produce VALID results,
but no one can know UNLESS this completely non-computer very simple process
is followed instead: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

It is understandable that this may be disappointing, but you should instead
be delighted to KNOW.

Nov 12 2010: Besides, the last thing we need is yet more
"know-nothing-experts" to testiLIE to the people. 

This is pure chicanery, just more artificial niche creation creating more
turf and territory simply because no one knows what else to do with
themselves due to myopic leadership in a "Cannibalistic Tyranny of Lies"
that has created this mass mental illness, that can only be cured when we
fully automate all labor via Wageless Economy Robotic©, see here:
http://goo.gl/WcMWo

So rather than being against technology, we are for it in spades, but the
proper application of it, not these franken botch jobs like EVS that
demonstrate clearly that some have no idea what everything really means at a
fundamental level which is very dangerous when extrapolated as an algorithm
over time and space in the REAL here & now.

Our premise is that TRUE human nature is divine and that we should do all we
can to acknowledge this in an infinite bountiful universe Providence has
bequeathed us: http://goo.gl/WcMWo

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 12 2010: Robert G, just remember as you already seem to be aware, that
ANYTHING can be reverse engineered after the fact to reflect the desired
outcome, especially with computers, as no matter what, what ever is
presented is just a pattern of 1s and 0s, so just make sure the pattern is
what you want it to be. All the twists and turns and "process" are
obfuscation of this fact. 

Truth is simple, only lies are complex to weary the mark into closing his
eyes, even for a millisecond, to allow the snatch and grab.

The only system where this is not the case is this one which uses no "magic"
has no sleeves or strings no dark areas, no high priests, no tRUST, no none
of that , just paper, chalk and people: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Also please check this out too: http://goo.gl/GN4D where you will see that
uniting EVS with this crazy "free-will is an illusion" pseudo-scientific
RELIGION is the biggest threat to humanity ever that we must spread the word
about to others NOW.

friend. 

However to say only the angry mob counts is not true at all, in fact the
angry mob is precisely what the bad pseudo-elites provocateur to justify all
THEIR atrocities. 

The so called "American Revolution" was a completely staged event via a
controlled fake "opposition" of the most duplicitous satanic creatures to
walk this earth selling everyone out in a grand charade, even spouting
freedom for all, except if you are black in which case you are only 3/5 of a
human, even having the audacity to commit that to writing Article I, Section
2, Paragraph 3 of US Constitution. 

For first 85 years the steps of the US Capitol were used to buy & sell not
just slaves, but their CHILDREN.

Did you know there are actually fools out there who call themselves

There are serious about it too, they have HUGE money behind them at various
"universities" and have even published "papers" claiming to have proven
their preposterous claims.

Well you know, they may have a point if EVS is allowed to make any further
inroads, because our votes will NOT indicate our will under it, thus hand in

Nov 12 2010: The key point is that Computers are appropriate in many
applications, but not all, due to their ability to create cyberspace, that
place where no human can go, and the ease within which anything can be made
to be "true" via "say so".

These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to visualize
and hypothesize ANYTHING, thus are the very weakness that prohibit their use
in the determination of PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP especially since it is not
required to do so per this solution: http://goo.gl/mq3zh no matter how
enticing it would be to be able to use them, just KNOW you cannot.

Thus: "If it were appropriate we would, but as it is not we mustn't"

So all talk about this & that within the verboten context of EVS is itself
verboten. It is not as if we can massage it this way or that to make is
"right" it is a non-starter, do not even go there because you are WRONG a
priori.

Nov 12 2010: This is what Eric Blair calls DOUBLESPEAK...

To say that a voter can verify how they voted to their self, but to no one
else is pure hokum. 

Likewise to say that software can be proven to have "worked" without having
to trust that it does not contain bugs, is also hokum and sophistry.

This is very dangerous to have so many caveatted aspects to a system,
requiring a priest class to "interpret" it and "explain" it, we already have

If there is no way to tell, then even the voter cannot be sure, is that not
what you have just said ? Come on man, snap to.

Also, even if you do get a website to tell you who you cast your vote for,
that does not mean it was totaled correctly, REMEMBER the TWO SETS of BOOKS
Gambit that this scheme does NOT and CANNOT PREVENT simply because it, like
ALL E-Voting Systems cannot, please people, do we really have to keep
reminding you of this ?

Besides if someone wants to buy votes, that is the choice of the seller, we
cannot get into all that, FREE WILL is FREE WILL, that is the whole point of
ELECTIONS, WE DECIDE WHO WE VOTE for, no one else.

It is JUST as self-evident to the awake that E-Voting Schemes are NOT
tRUST-FREE, no papers required.

We have already clearly established to everyone RIGHT HERE, that ALL E-Voter
Schemes must needs be tainted with tRUST since there are parts to them that
are NOT in clear view at ALL TIMES to EVERYONE voting. 

A computer is black box, meaning NO ONE can see inside it, it creates
CyberSpace, that space where humans cannot go with their physical bodies.

Source code may or may not reflect the program running on a machine, this
too can NEVER be certified, so as you say in your talk, we need to take a

Nov 11 2010: Hi Daniel, coercion is always a factor, no matter what. Hence
the reason we must KNOW that it is possible to elect good people and get the
bullies out of office. 

Fortunately there is a way that we KNOW will work, called the
SYNCHRO-MOSES-VISION© PERFECT VOTING SYSTEM, which for the first time ever
has had its amazingly simple details revealed to the public for you to go
read here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Hence the need to ONLY use this very simple 100% fail-safe ZERO TRUST ZERO
COMPUTERS system: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 11 2010: Layers, schmayers. Come on David, get real... 

This is one of the classic 25 rules of Disinformation described here:
http://goo.gl/15fEE, tire them out with "layers", the ole human buffer
overflow con, until they feel safe or accept your lie through pure
exhaustion, same thing in the end. 

1 layer, 400 layers, what is the difference other than obfuscation, or what
we call security-via-obscurity which is not security at all. 

Many different so called "trusted" parties to have to TRUST, why so complex
and ultimately fatally flawed despite all the layers of obfuscation to hide
the lie in, it is still a lie, why not just use the newly revealed FULLY for
the first time ever SYNCHRO-MOSES-VISION© PERFECT VOTING SYSTEM
http://goo.gl/mq3zh which is perfect every time by design with ZERO FRAUD
and ZERO COMPLEXITY, ZERO TRUST, hence no place to finagle in.

Nov 11 2010: Good Gravy Michael, are you serious ? How many dolts are there
out there? We have already discussed all this ad nausem here, i.e. that just
because you can look up your vote when you get home, does not mean that the
RESULTS/TOTALS are sacrosanct, can you grasp that my friend ? Dawkins
introduced this exquisitely below.

The education level really has dropped incredibly, there seem to be too few
who can think big picture, holographically out there. No wonder there is so
much corruption and chicanery. It is like stealing candy from babies. One
eyed man is king of the blind.

Please come up to speed Michael my friend when you discover our perfect
voting system that GUARANTEES TRUE RESULTS EVERY-TIME WITHOUT TRUST of
ANYKIND and only uses technology that has been available for 10,000 years,
i.e. Chalk and People: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 10 2010: Bismark throws around words like "many vs. few" as if this is
somehow just a matter of making stew for the 3 little bears.

Ah this one is just right, when what we are talking about has NO GREY AREAS
unless of course you want to make some to hide stuff in and obfuscate from,
what utter rubbish !!! Hokum, and you silly fools are going along for the
ride.

Wake up while you still can, once the fools allow everyone to go fully under
VR, you will not need a body anymore, if you beLIEve that, what are you
waiting for, turn yours in right now, think of the convenience of everything
being virtual including your self !

But alas, that is NOT why you are currently in a physical body now is it?

We cannot be anti-physical chauvinists without leading to our own physical
disappearance.

Take everything full out to test if you should even begin on that road, THAT
is the purpose of virtual, i.e. imagination, not to replace REALITY, but to
make it safer.

Nov 10 2010: Bismark continues to feign he wants to protect you, but know
this, he is either intentionally deceiving you, or is very confused, i.e.
blinded by the "science", best case scenario. 

For even knaves KNOW it is NOT possible to secure E-Voting systems.

Perhaps Bismark has never been responsible for cash, and does not understand
that it IS possible to create NO-TRUST SYSTEMS, which are ALWAYS PHYSICAL in
nature. Think about the people who design casinos, bank vaults etc, they
must trust no one, since no one can be trusted. 

No math is required, only cold hard LOGIC, which while it can be conveyed to
others via a mathematical allegory, is nevertheless purely physical in
implementation and precisely why we cannot ever leave the physical and tell
people we are "fail-safe"

The connection between physical & virtual cannot be reversed, virtual can
only describe physical, but can never BE IT.

All scams exploit knaves inability to understand this.

Nov 10 2010: Indeed Roberto, well said. However David has NOT acknowledged
being 'wonderfully aware of them' or anything else, in fact quite the
contrary.

To debate the obvious is to insult the truth, and give credit to falsehood,
yet we must speak the truth nevertheless so truth is obvious to all.

TRUE: EVS CANNOT EVER BE SECURE, only this 10,000 year old "technology" can
http://goo.gl/mq3zh precisely because it affords no place or time to commit
crime as it uses the voters themselves as the observers in lock step
aggregation of results up to the final, and it can all be done on one sacred
election day, which is REAL PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY as laid out here:

Nov 10 2010: Thank you David for providing the context to discuss the
obvious and TED for providing the forum in which to do so.

A great way to see it is as follows.

Challenge to ALL:

Those who control what you beLIEve to be nebulous, control you without you
even knowing it: YET you, like them, can know, when you FREELY choose to NOT
beLIEve, and choose to ONLY know, ALWAYS.

HOW YOU MUST FREELY CHOOSE TO RESPOND:

So do not be nebulous. Be very clear on what is and what is not and never
can be.

Likewise, no one can deceive you except you. All deception is
self-deception, especially when you are NOT aware of it. Those who are fully
awake see you fast asleep. Wise even warn you as your safety is theirs. How
do you know you are in a dream ? Isn't it enough to simply ask ?

So be aware.

This is why you exist in fact, and the only thing that keeps you here among
the living to forever keep you here whole.

is dog and ponied to the public, behind a website that always tells the
truth for individuals who take the time to check their vote online.. 

And other "views" that are used to represent the "outcome" of the election,
which of course to defend privacy advocates legitimate concerns for secrecy,
can never be verified to be or not be representative of what actually took
place. NEVER.

Thus the only remedy is to have the voters themselves validate en masse, per

as described here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

There simply is NO OTHER WAY, so stop wasting your time trying to find the

Nov 9 2010: .
Perspective Folks:

Thesis:

VR/Cyberspace can destroy REAL REALITY if we let mental defectives control
its rollout.

Virtual Reality and cyberspace are valuable to humanity only when they
enhance REAL REALITY, not when they destroy it. 

If we allow CYBERSPACE to suck REAL REALITY into it via E-Voting Schemes
which by definition can NEVER be secured precisely because they create a
virtual reality where anything can be said to be true, whether it matches
physical reality or not.

Mental Defectives are those who cannot differentiate between REAL REALITY
which always contains VIRTUAL REALITY, and VIRTUAL REALITY which can never
contain REAL REALITY, only represent it, since it is itself NOT reality.
Just as the map is not the territory, nor the menu the meal.

VR can be used to help the blind see more REALITY, but must never be allowed
to blind those who can already see it, which is precisely why we cannot use
it for elections, but instead ONLY this: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

However, there is nothing to understand about ANY E-voting system other than
they can NOT EVER be secured PERIOD, before you even start, whether you get
it or not, save yourself the time and effort, it just is not possible, just
as there is no pot of gold at the end of rainbows, BY DEFINITION, a priori
NOT POSSIBLE

This is because EVERY E-voting scheme REQUIRES TRUST.

There however is a way where NO ONE & NO THING need be trusted, and this my
friend is the NO-TEK solution that has been obfuscated for at least 10,000
years precisely because it GUARANTEES a fair vote every single time,
something that Tyrants just cannot allow to be understood because it would
necessarily mean they do not get to be in power.

YET it is SO EASY to understand & implement that most just cannot see it,

the room until all votes are agreed per precinct, or in case of Vegas, all
cash is accounted for, level of veracity.

When each vote is pure, each precinct is pure, when each precinct is pure
each county is pure.

When each vote is questionable, so is each precinct etc.

"trust" too, like the others ? Can't you even detect your own recursion ?

SS, really takes the cake comparing one fraudulent system as the model for
another. 

Obfuscation you cannot detect that nevertheless exists by design above your
head is not an excuse to just give in and accept and trust "experts" who
given the same question will give different answers, besides the whole basis
is flawed, and of course once you accept the flawed basis everything else is
"acceptable" to the weak minded.

What type of work have you done SS that allows you to so cavalierly treat
the truth as if it did not really matter all that much, or perhaps, in your
mind is really not knowable ? Why not just use Ouija Boards or Fortune

2. Everyone in the counting room @ end of day can see how many REAL people

that are not claimed are wiped from the board until the number of people and
votes match. This is REAL democracy, requiring JUST ONE day of REAL

3. Since each vote is pure, each precinct is pure, since each precinct is
pure, each county is pure and so on. Since you cannot steal the precincts
everything else in locked in as precincts are too big to steal only if they

Nov 8 2010: Bismark is either feigning stupidity or isn't, simple two state
logic. 

Dawson asked the question quite straightforwardly, Bismark's answer assumes
we are idiots, as it does not address the "DOUBLE SET of BOOKs" nor the "END
RUN" gambits, either of which could give individuals answers they expect
while still stealing the election. 

High Quality Fraud systems can even reverse engineer paper trails real time
to fit desired outcomes without even "trusted" observers noticing to satisfy
all observations, all EXCEPT the all in one view afforded per precinct as it
unfolds @ end of day with all voters present per this: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
hence your need use it and to abandon all other methods. 

The reason Bismark cannot address these issues is because it simply is not
possible to preclude such chicanery outside of this NO-TEK system based on
Vegas Card Counting Certainty, where there is no trust, there should be none
in our elections either: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

<br><hr><br>A comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 8 2010: Dawson's exquisite mind experiment proves Bismark's system is
pure chicanery.

There are 4 voters A B C D in precinct Z, for parties X & Y. 

A B C D vote for X. A has no clue who B C or D are or how they have voted. 

The final count is 1 vote for X & 3 for Y. 

Question: 1. How could this be done? Easily.

And 2. How would A know a fraud has been committed?
A doesn't know if the final count 1 for X & 3 for Y is correct. He only
knows how he has voted not how the others voted.

THUS the ONLY way to prevent this, is actually very simple. A B C D from
precinct Z reconvene at days end TOGETHER to verify their votes have been
counted correctly.

All precinct Z votes & deli codes are displayed on a giant board visible to
all, each voter can deny or affirm their vote was correctly recorded without
telling others how they voted.

Everyone knows how many REAL people are in REAL room & how many REAL votes
are on board.

And 2. How would A know a fraud has been committed?
A doesn't know if the final count 1 for X & 3 for Y is correct. He only
knows how he has voted not how the others voted.

THUS the ONLY way to prevent this, is actually very simple. A B C D from
precinct Z reconvene at days end TOGETHER to verify their votes have been
counted correctly.

All precinct Z votes & deli codes are displayed on a giant board visible to
all, each voter can deny or affirm their vote was correctly recorded without
telling others how they voted.

Everyone knows how many REAL people are in REAL room & how many REAL votes
are on board.

Nov 8 2010: There is absolutely NO WAY anyone can count on 'SOMEONE' ELSE to
verify that ALL votes, not even their own, has been "counted" correctly. 

It is mere child's play to devise a "TWO SETS of BOOKs" system which can
tell you what YOUR vote was, and STILL make the TOTALs be whatever they
decide them to be at the last moment. 

There must be no time delay between election day and the results at the end
of the day, via NO-TEK per precinct verification as described here
http://goo.gl/mq3zh 

WE ALL are the observers, you cannot trust anyone else to do this, EVER.

Only WE CAN do this at OUR precinct together on an all day election day, via
the SIMPLE NO-TEK way described here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

There is no rush, each precinct is of a manageable size, it can all be done
at the end of the all day sacred election day.

If we can verify each precinct is correct, which we can very simply, the
totals of all precincts will be correct as well, as described here

Nov 8 2010: David, this is a lie and you know it, when you say there is no
part that we have to blindly trust. Now you are bold faced lying, first
thought it was simply intellectual misunderstanding on your part, but now
you have flat-out lied. 

The results themselves cannot be verified, we must trust the reporting of
the results under every system except http://goo.gl/mq3zh, as reporting is
the only part that matters, as it is the summation of everything else that
took place before it, and the only part that must be rigged to steal the
election, thus we cannot depend on anything between us and the reporting of
the results, as everything else you have described is just a way to gain the
"confidence" of the voters, i.e. a "process" was used, but WE must be the
process from start to finish in each precinct via this simple NO-TEK
solution that cannot be hijacked as everyone per precinct that voted is
there to see THEIR precincts totals accurately fed into the aggregate.

nearly as alarming as all the fools who take your "idea" seriously.

Are we dealing with children here ? 

No sooner did we agree that NO TRUST is acceptable, did you then launch into
the specious "idea" that spreading it around somehow eliminates it, just as
evil industrialists, there are good ones too, want us to believe toxic waste
spread around by smoke stacks or used as fertilizer over millions of acres
some how gets rid of it.

ZERO is ZERO, anything else is not. 

This system must have ZERO trust to be itself trusted, ZERO....

There must be ZERO hiding places in a system that determines something as
sacred as who our leaders are. They must not be allowed to hijack it as you
say.

Bismark's system, and all E-systems, are FRAUDULENT straight out of the

in a fraudulent system.

The people cannot trust anyone within their ranks, especially those who
believe they are somehow above the "regular" people, this is a fundamental
concept of TRUTH.

Thus we can have no system that hides any aspect of itself from anyone at
anytime, it must be visible in its entirety all at once, every precinct at a
time. 

If you morons really cannot understand this low tech fail safe approach you
are not qualified to protect anyone from anything, nor even your dangerously
silly selves and must be protected by those who do understand the dangers of
putting idiots in charge of anything, especially determining who our leaders
are.

Yes any of you who entertain any sort of electronic voting system whatsoever
are all fools, as you do not understand first principles. 

There is no way to secure a system meant to tabulate the decisions of a
group of people unless that group of people does it themselves all at once
on the spot, which of course is possible. 

No different than other virtual problems like gold coin versus paper money.
Same thing.

Nov 2 2010: BOGUS: The only way to verify a physical vote is to have
everyone who voted to view a single physical board per precinct with all the
votes cast displayed with a code next to each vote that each voter will be
able to view and acknowledge, or deny, that indeed that is how they voted by
matching it with the code they received when they cast their votes, without
of course revealing who they voted for, yes all of them must be present at
the same time, with no one dissenting, which can be done on a precinct by
precinct basis. There can be no electronics involved of any kind, none.
There simply is no other way, and yes it is as simple as this.

As for logistics, voting is that important, that it must be an entire day
off, that is the least we can do for something this important, alas they
know this too, and do not really what to hear what you really think.

A comment on Talk: Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren
Mar 27 2008: Jose Tavares: 

Thanks for your cogent description of religion generically... 

I would like to agree with you on the generics and also delve deeper into
the historical application of these generics as described below in my post,
wherein it was discussed how the Roman Empire attempted to apply your
generics in the destruction of the only civilization to not bend its knee to
the Roman Juggernaut, and that in order to destroy Judaism, they
parasitically attached a new religion to Judaism, forged it to appear as a
natural progression from it, via the Jesus Story, and that as a result, they
not only attempted to steal the power of Judaism, they also created a huge
force that produced billions of robotic humans to toil endlessly generation
after generation, essentially throwaway disposable people, and that as a
result, we are delaying the advent of REAL LIFE EVERLASTING BEFORE DEATH,
via the Emancipation of Humanity from the Machinery of Economy through the
REAL ROBOTIC WAGELESS ECONOMY - http://RoboEco.com/ttenned

And that moreover, the bullies who have coasted on this easy system of
domination of humans will never stop unless we intelligently transition, and
ironically are preventing themselves from living forever BEFORE death,
because of their addiction to the ill gotten easy spoils of the current
system.

A comment on Talk: Richard Dawkins on militant atheism
Mar 27 2008: Just because most religions are false does not mean all
are..........

You existence proves everything you need to know, i.e. why is there not just
nothing ?

You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in terms
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether it is
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.

That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go back
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus should be
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The
Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first, it goes
without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue
with as not being virtuous.

This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so we
are not taken for fools forever.

If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the highest
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what do you
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?

Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever exploitation of
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating "holding
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still people
"naively" "debate" it.

What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?

Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity is an
effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially catatonic/robotic
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real" people
get on with ruling in "reality" ?

If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion that
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not bend the
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via the
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new dogma
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a conquering
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a bully's
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?

Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.

If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human, what do
you expect for its adherents ?
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?


Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.

This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also seems
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.

Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is very
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman Empire,
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?

If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the same
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations sacrifice,
correct ?

Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense ?
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?

Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?

Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on the
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my assertions
false, they must be true !???

Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know the
context.

The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?

Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for intentional
sins in any case. Study friend, study.

Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and Eve's
sins.

It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for their
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not questioning the
framework itself.


Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not
surprisingly, exploitative.

Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way around,
agreed ?

We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we really
get that upset about them ripping people off ?

We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep in
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT Christians,
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we know
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built on
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered Jewish
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today
notwithstanding.

In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like an
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see Rabbi
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org

and

Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures

We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews for
Jesus FrankenFaith.


Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers as
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole deal,
and who is there to argue with you ?

If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.

At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying to
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short, and
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish Scriptures
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for
starters.

Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's sins
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!

Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of accounting and
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of truth
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be
manipulated at will.

Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed millions of
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age of
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once and
for ALL !!!

We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep in
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT Christians,
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we know
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built on
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered Jewish
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today
notwithstanding.

In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like an
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see Rabbi
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org

and

Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures

We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews for
Jesus FrankenFaith.


Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers as
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole deal,
and who is there to argue with you ?

If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.

At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying to
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short, and
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish Scriptures
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for
starters.

Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's sins
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!

Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of accounting and
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of truth
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be
manipulated at will.

Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed millions of
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age of
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once and
for ALL !!!

A comment on Talk: Rick Warren on a life of purpose
Mar 27 2008: Rick:

LET OUR PEOPLE GO !!!

Instead of focusing only on what is good for one group, but instead on a way
where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The Inevitable Robotic Wageless
Economy", more on that below, but first, it goes without saying that the
attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue with as not being virtuous.

This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so we
are not taken for fools forever.

If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the highest
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what do you
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?

Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever exploitation of
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating "holding
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still people
"naively" "debate" it.

What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?

Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity is an
effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially catatonic/robotic
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real" people
get on with ruling in "reality" ?

If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion that
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not bend the
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via the
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new dogma
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a conquering
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a bully's
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?

Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.

If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human, what do
you expect for its adherents ?
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?


Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.

Rick, thank you for being studious and interested in the truth in all
things.

This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also seems
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.

Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is very
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman Empire,
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?

If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the same
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations sacrifice,
correct ?

Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense ?
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?

Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?

Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on the
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my assertions
false, they must be true !???

Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know the
context.

The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?

Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for intentional
sins in any case. Study friend, study.

Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and Eve's
sins.

It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for their
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not questioning the
framework itself.


Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not
surprisingly, exploitative.

Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way around,
agreed ?

We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we really
get that upset about them ripping people off ?

A comment on Talk: Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren
Mar 26 2008: Dan:

You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in terms
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether it is
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.

That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go back
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus should be
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The
Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first, it goes
without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could argue
with as not being virtuous.
