comment on Talk: Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of China
35 minutes ago: .
In fairness to Martin, he may not be
able to see the new economic paradigm that WE-R&copy;
That is just how big it is, i.e. it really does solve all issues, for
everyone, yet it is so simple, i.e. as the truth always is. We
encourage Martin to study it
here at his leisure, and earliest
convenience: http://goo.gl/wH0rg

THAT THEY TOO CAN BE FREE

Let real ROBOTS be ROBOTS,

Human beings were born to be.
All humans are worthy, yes all even

that allows ALL to EXPRESS their

no matter what. Yes it is possible
without losers, as defined when we
said ALL.

comment on Talk: Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of China
1 hour ago: .
Besides Martin's gross jingoistic generalizations, sweeping over
simplifications, heavy reliance on
false dichotomies, assumptions that he knows the Chinese better than
Westerners, despite being
a Westerner himself, is laughable.
His assumptions that anyone is "puzzled" is puzzling.
Martin is a straight-up con-artist working for those who
have molded Chinese people into their own obedient ROBOTS, whether they
realize it or not: is now trying to play them off his own people with
complete treachery which
is not surprising when you consider what his type has done
to the Chinese people over the centuries, just read here:
http://goo.gl/eSIF
"New" Kind of paradigm ?
WE-R&copy; the new model WE-R&copy; Wageless Economy - Robotic&copy;
Leave this world ALIVE... as WE-R&copy;
So WE-R&copy; clearly the new paradigm
not whatever Martin his secret mason
brethren imagine.
Our system works for all, unlike their way where all work for them !!!

The truth behind why China's people are being propagandized against the
west, a truth that you hopefully had nothing to do with, yet you need
to KNOW
about, to avoid being propagandized
yourself, and so both peoples, both westerners and easterners can see
who the REAL COMMON ENEMY IS.
So this COMMON enemy the world over can come to its senses sooner
rather than later.

A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
4 days ago: .
Hi Gregory,
Your goals are noble, and ones we share wholeheartedly.
However you are 100% WRONG, that David's "system",
or any ELECTRONIC voting system for that matter, would
do anything but provide an impenetrable "deceit monopoly" to a new
"priest-class" that the entire world would be
at the mercy of, enforced by a police state that you supposedly "voted"
in !!!
What is more, it would not even be detectable, as the verification
process is such that mere mortals would be convinced of its"veracity"
via techno-chauvinsim, and "expert" interpretation.
These "experts" would also be deceived by the "high-priests" who
"train" them.
Thus the absolutely most important thing for you to do Gregory, is to
share this
truth as far and wide as you can as soon as you can.
HOWEVER, there is a sure fire NO-TECH solution that REALLY
works, &amp; EVERYONE can agree is 100% FAIL-SAFE EVERYTIME.
Please read about it here friend:

A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Jan 10 2011: Furthermore, there can be no place for trust in the
election
process precisely because the whole idea is to insure that the will of
the
voters is expressed and that no one be able to subvert that process,
including those to whom trust is currently placed, who could then
violate
that trust to perpetuate their vaunted position of being trusted in the
first place without being detected with unsecureable election methods
such
as all EVS inherently are.
Once the people's will has been expressed, THOSE who won the election
NOW
have their trust, but not before.
Hence it is only through a system that eliminates the need for trust
completely during the sacred election process itself that we can be
assured
of this.
here is that system: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
Be well Ngan, and thanks for your participation in the discuss !!!

Jan 10 2011: Hi ngan, as soon as one mentions the words "officers", and
"have to show", all bets are off and anonymity is destroyed.
The FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system has no "officers": we must not have two
levels
of people, because when we do, we always end up with abuse, guaranteed
!!!
See how Mikko's excellent question is deftly handled
under FAIL-SAFE PROCEDURE DEFINED, section 5.7
here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
Also, each vote is sacred, big numbers mean nothing, &amp; must not be
allowed
to be the basis for hiding things in big numbers. Besides, no EVS can
insure
anyone their vote was corrected either, simply not possible, as it
still
requires "faith" &amp; "trust" in others. As soon as you admit that, no
matter
how many processes you wrap verification in, you still do not have
verification, only the possibility of it, and then the process becomes
social engineering, to make people beLIEve it is official because
"officials" were involved.

Jan 10 2011: .
Excellent question Mikko
Under our FAIL-SAFE-VOTING system, this is handled during the anonymous
yet
PUBLIC verification stage PER precinct and just that vote is corrected,
no
need to redo the entire election. please review here: goo.gl/mq3zh
This is not possible in any electronic voting system, simply not
possible
because it could still be wrong and the voter would only have received
lip
service. And you are correct, liars can ruin many things, which is
precisely why we
need a process to give the voters a chance to keep them out of office.

Yes indeed it is CV. Here is the best way to do that which you
describe: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
It is important to note that David's system is naive, best case
scenario.
It appeals to techno-chauvinists, and is very dangerous in reality as
it
creates a false sense of "security", yet in reality can only be
"secured"
with a Police State to back it up, which makes voting meaningless
anyway.

Hi Naiem, You hit the nail through the board, bravo.
THERE IS NO WAY to PREVENT THIS except this way: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
In fact, electronically, real time, they can fake only the exact number
they
need to, the needle in the hay-stack gambit, to get the desired outcome
WITH
plausible deniability, then use all the fancy schmancy "cybersecurity"
mumbo
jumbo to "certify" it, and once done, there is no way to prove they did
it,
pretty scary huh, yet it is also true, they will then have a monopoly
on
deceit, only "they" will be able to cheat, and no one can even prove
that
they have, UNLESS we use this method which prevents its possibility
altogether straight out the gate, WITHOUT a POLICE STATE to "enforce
it": http://goo.gl/mq3zh

A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 22 2010: Combine this with the FACT that since this algorithm is
&amp; must
be published completely to be trusted at all, in the nevertheless
always
untrustworthy Cybernetic domain, it is trivial to know the product PQ
has
only TWO factors, i.e. P &amp; Q as primes dictate ! Even worse, even
though there is no largest prime, they do thin out VERY
quickly as you go up, thus factoring them becomes a trivial matter even
with
GARGANTUAN P &amp; Q, as they trail off in density inversely
EXPONENTIALLY to
the natural log N, base e as N increases.
So we have a VERY WELL KNOWN FIXED NON-MOVING TARGET, i.e. the primes,
which
have been studied &amp; PUBLISHED since the earliest recorded times,
whose
density drops off dramatically as you go up, THUS PK is ALL MYSTIQUE
&amp;
BLUFF, as so few really have taken even the minimum amount of time to
understand it as we have laid it out above: each simply taking OTHERS
word
for it, not realizing that they haven't looked into it either, FOOLS.

Nov 22 2010: .
x = MMI of a (mod y) simply means what integer value of x will make
ax%y=1
In other words, a times what integer when divided by y gives
remainder=1?
This x is the MMI of a (mod y), yes it is that simple.
Thus we have d=MMI 3 (mod 4) = 7 because (3*7)/4=5 with remainder 1
Our message, m=8
We encrypt m giving us cyphertext c=m^e % N = 8*8*8 % 10 = 512 % 10 = 2
Thus P=2, Q=5, N=10, Z=4, e=3, d=7, m=8, c=2
Now lets decrypt it and see if it is what we started with.
m=c^d % N = 2^7 % 10 = 128 % 10 = 8 !!!! It works, and yes it is that
simple.
NOW, lets see, the only thing we need to know is P &amp; Q and we get
it all.
We know PxQ, just not P &amp; Q themselves. We also know e !!!!
Thus we need only factor PxQ, how hard can that be, even if P&amp;Q are
huge,
how bout not hard at all !!!
WHY ? Well lets start off with the fact that the primes are FIXED never
change,
and we know TONS of them already.

Nov 22 2010: But as you appear to want to understand how cryptography
works,
please read the following, it is very simple as all truth is, and is
very
important for the individual to understand and use with other
individuals as
needed to protect the individual from the State as the State is the
biggest
mass murderer of all time when armed with technologies meant to serve
only
the individual, hope this fine yet most importatnt distinction is clear
to
everyone. It is similar to all classic philisophical razor edge
distinctions, e.g.
what is appropriate in one context, and most beautiful etc, can be
completely horrid &amp; deadly in another, same exact thing, just wrong
context,
catastrophic outcome.
Now please how easy it is to understand and thus break the following:
Public Key Encryption EXACTLY as it is:
P=2, Q=5 are Prime
N=PQ=10
Z=(P-1)(Q-1)=4
encryption key e=3, can be anything coprime to Z
Public Key is N &amp; e
Private Key d is MMI = modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod Z)

A. Cybernetic Voting cannot be secured without a Police State, under
Police
State Dissent is impossible, thus reason enough not to use it.
B. Encryption that is not published completely cannot be trusted, that
which
is, can be broken, no matter what anyone tells you as we will
demonstrate
below, thus it too cannot be trusted since it can be broken.
C. The very people who can make complicated encryption are also smart
enough
to trick YOU when you beLIEve a word they say.
D. Do not take anyone's word for item C, just know that it is true. E.
Virtual must remain the servant of Real
F. Real cannot be allowed to be changed by virtual, this would be akin
to a
shadow controlling the one who cast it.
G. Just remember that the virtual in this case will be the shadow not
of the
the voters, but of the one you cannot see yet does exist and must
remain
encrypted, in its crypt to be able to operate, and thus must be
forbidden by
the living from entering our physical realm or suffer the same fate.

Admire everyone's desire to understand.
Just remember though that all bets are off once you cross the
cybernetic-threshhold which completely disconnects you from the real
physical world and needn't correspond in any way to it. That is rule
number
1. You really need not read the rest of this message in fact.
Hope this point is clear, and if not please ask.
Also let us not lose sight of the simple task we are trying to complete
here.
It is not as though we are trying to predict the weather 40 days from
now,
we are after all only trying to determine who we voted for, who REALLY
won,
an event which actually took place in non-cyber real reality, totals
that
can be completely obscured without anyone being able to prove it in
cyberspace, no matter what!
Yet what did happen on election day is known, it is an event we control
and
even invited everyone to participate in for crying out loud.
Powerful Catch-22s prevent those who understand from using Cybernetics
in
Elections in anyway:

Nov 17 2010: Great question Sameer, they cannot, it is not possible,
you can
only see that your vote is correct. And what if it isn't, do you really
think they will change everything just for you ? Get real. How do they
know
you are not lying and just trying to cause trouble ? This is all bluff
and feel good process obfuscation. They can work it backwards, i.e. see
how everyone voted to see just how much
fraud is required to get their desired results.
Then mathematically determine just how much fraud is necessary, then
add in
only the fake votes necessary, spread it across as many precincts as
necessary to avoid attention, targeting precincts based on demographics
that
provide plausible deniabilty. Then using this cooked result, run it
through all the "process", and voila
"irrefutable" proof.
Yet Sameer, as you may have suspected, there is a way, and it is VERY
simple
and requires no computers, in fact prohibits their use ab initio:

Nov 17 2010: Hi Richard, remember, all this process everyone is signing

But those of us who do, know it is all bluff &amp; obfuscation.
Your due diligence is rare Richard, most everyone is relying on
'experts'
who have not looked into it either. Big Lies work so well because no
one
believes anyone could be so audacious. Look at how long WTC 7 has
remained
hidden: even now people doubt it, even with Geraldo changing his mind
no
less. http://goo.gl/tHzS
The end run with reverse engineering of desired results using the very
protocols that gained your confidence would make such results
"irrefutable",
yet completely fabricated with everyone seeing exactly what they need
to
see, yet the results nevertheless being fabricated because unless you
get
EVERYONE to SEE and CONFIRM EVERYTHING @ same time PHYSICALLY, it is
but a
shell game that such sophisticated mathematics can certainly pull off.
Remember all truth is simple, only lies are complicated.

Nov 17 2010: We need look no deeper than if even one bit is off, an
entire
election can be destroyed. Of course they are bluffing so it's moot.
Today's cryptography depends on the use of PRIME numbers among other
techniques.
What do we know about prime numbers ?
Well we know there aren't as common as the others: they are fascinating
to
be sure.
Yet there is one very important aspect related to prime numbers that
ironically makes their use in cryptography inappropriate: thus renders
cryptography itself as the realm of bluffers extraordinaire,
con-artists,
chiseler flimflammers rivaling televangelists &amp; fiatists in every
way: their
retinue of mesmerized true-believers fully entranced.
So what is it about prime numbers that makes this so ?
It is the fact they are FIXED, KNOWN even PUBLISHED sufficiently !!

is
no way for you or anyone else to determine that unless YOU ALL SEE
EVERYTHING @ SAME TIME in PHYSICAL REALITY as this system

kind. Anything else is a shell game.
Besides, lets say you did object, what would they do, change your vote

real. Run as far and as fast as you can away from this "idea" only
after you
have warned others my friend. Please read everything else here my

The key point is that Computers are appropriate in many applications,
but
not all, due to their ability to create cyberspace, that place where no
human can go, and the ease within which anything can be made to be
"true"
via "say so".
These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to
visualize
and hypothesize ANYTHING, thus are the very weakness that prohibit
their use
in the determination of PHYSICAL LEADERSHIP especially since it is not
required to do so per this solution: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 16 2010: Vikas, theoretically it is indeed intriguing but cannot
EVER be
used in the real world.
Cyberspace is that place no human can go with their body. Where any
thing
can be made true with no physical connection to reality.
The end run with reverse engineering of desired results using the very
protocols that gained your confidence would make such results
"irrefutable",
yet completely fabricated with everyone seeing exactly what they need
to
see, yet the results nevertheless being fabricated because unless you
get
EVERYONE to SEE and CONFIRM EVERYTHING @ same time PHYSICALLY, it is
but a
shell game that such sophisticated mathematics can certainly pull off.
Thus the only system that is 100% FAIL-SAFE bans the use of computers
altogether, precisely because they are A. not necessary, and B. because
their use necessarily PRECLUDES the ability to secure it due to
cybernetic
"SAY SO" they bring to the table.

Nov 16 2010: For those who know, Cryptography is all bluff in reality.
It shrewdly exploits an asymmetry in awareness of legitimate
mathematical
principles, to foist a fraud on even those who merely BELIEVE they are
cryptographic 'experts', being named such by others they have not
pondered
deeply enough that those who have named them such are themselves not
aware
of this self-deception in their ranks, or that those who do know this
choose
not to tell them precisely because it achieves the desired result of
THEIR
BLUFF !!
Which is to create a faith-based-religion that asserts that truth can
be
hidden for a long enough time to prevent others from accessing it in a
timely manner, which assumes incorrectly the existence of 'time' as a
physical quality.
This is the crux.
As time does not exist in physical reality, there is no way to use it
to
your advantage WITHOUT deception.
Like voodoo, crypto works only on those who believe it does.

A reply on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 16 2010: S B: Above you state "Nifty puzzles come out of this
field".
Very true.
Cryptography's purpose is to protect the individual from state: never
used
by 'state' against the individual, thus a moratorium, out right ban
against
state use of cryptography &amp; cybernetic ELECTIONS must take place.
The only place for computers in government is EVERYTHING else, just not
ELECTIONS &amp; just not cryptography, as it only serves to enable
those who
commandeer state to exert their will in secret over those who have not
&amp;
would never even be interested in doing so, thus it must be banned from
state altogether so we do not have to wonder whether it has been
subverted
or not.
Even with such a ban there would be as there is now, a shadow state
that
does manipulate, but at least this way it will be VERY clear they are
doing
so outside the law. We must keep the lines of demarcation clear &amp;
we can, or
only the crooks will have free-will.
State is the biggest mass murderer.

Nov 15 2010: .
Truth is obvious to the pure of heart.
Truth
There are many partial-truths. There is a partial-truth for every being
and
for every particle of the universe --for each one reflects everything
else
in a different way.
To seek truth means more than finding your own partial-truth. It means
finding THE truth that works for you and for the other guy, for now and
forever, in this place and everywhere, for the body and for the soul,
for
the sage and for the young, innocent child. The higher the
partial-truth, the fewer boundaries it knows.
Truth travels the world over, because wherever it goes, it is at least
partially rejected and must move on.
Partial-truth is always a FOUL LIE, for every lie is a sentence that
has
true words in it. more on this here: http://goo.gl/KzMe

Nov 15 2010: Only self-evident truth is true, is very simple to
understand.
All truth is obvious and simple.
Only lies are complex and require long winded explanations to
"understand".
Many agree just because they do not want to appear stupid, when most
times
that is who really is.
Lies have to be complex because neither exist in reality where
everything is
simple.
Lies must be complex to hide the fact they are lies to as many as they
can
get away with.
If truth is not obvious to you, it means you have disconnected from
yourself, and are confusing things which do not belong together, and it
becomes a mystery to you.
Complex does not exist in reality, only simplex relationships.
Just because there are many simplex relationships does not mean that
complexity exists anymore than just because there are many individuals
that
groups exist.
All so called "complex" systems can always be reduced into a set of
simplex
relationships none of which contains any mystery at all.

Nov 15 2010: Sir Richard, above you mention in so many words that you
will
conclude nothing until a so called "expert" says so. That is what we
call
"say so".
As if others should do your work for you. Today more than ever,
although it
was always true, WE OURSELVES MUST and CAN BE the "expert".
Dependency on others is weak &amp; very dangerous.
It brings out contempt in those who do know especially when they are
expected to work for the lazy who do not even bother to see the
obvious.
Only self-evident truth is true. Same with self-deception, it is always
the
self that deceives the self, no one else can deceive you.
If they can know, you can know unless you are admitting some mental
defect
of course.
If someone can know, you can know too, or that which is claimed to be
known
in fact cannot be. Alas, the precisely the point.
Until and unless you reduce everything to that simple logic, you will
forever tRUST and be betrayed by those you thought were doing work you
could
have done yourself.

unfathomable
perhaps, one can only wonder.
As Simson Garfinkel states in his classic "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy"
page
53, and others have in similar fashion elsewhere:
"Many companies claim that their programs use proprietary encryption
algorithms. These companies assure you that their algorithms are secure
but
nevertheless won't reveal the algorithms that their products use. Ask
them
for details &amp; you're likely to be told, 'If we told you then the
program
would be less secure.' You should avoid these programs; usually, the
companies don't reveal their encryption systems because they are
embarrassed
by how easily the systems are broken. Remember, if the security of the
system is really depended on the secrecy of the algorithm, a determined
attacker would merely have to get a copy"

DOUBLESPEAK
The ability to speak or write two or more contradictory ideas without

See democracy is based upon a bedrock of individual inalienable rights
that
even democracy cannot infringe. Those rights begin and END with the
in-divid-ual. Only once those are secure can issues ABOVE those be
determined via
democracy, and those determinations may not reach back down into the
bedrock
of inalienable rights to impact them in any way, hence their being
named
inalienable, inviolable.
If the individual is considered sacred and protected, all groups will
be as
well, as groups are all made up of individuals, so there is no such
thing as
group rights, as all such notions always diminish the rights of the
individual.
Hence the need to protect the sanctity of ELECTIONS, and prohibit

leave, would you please describe in YOUR own words how DistKeyGen
&amp; Shares work? 1000 letters is plenty, e.g. something like this:
There is no largest prime number.
Proof.
1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.
2 Let p denote the largest prime number.
3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p
4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series
5 Thus q + 1 is either prime GT p, or has a prime factor GT p.

Nov 14 2010: Cryptography is a great thing, just not for Elections, no
not
ever.
CRYPTOGRAPHY is to protect the individual from the mob, not the other
way
around.
The real and only purpose of cryptography is to permit individuals to
communicate with each other with 100% privacy, and NOT for governments
and
corporations to exercise tyranny over the individual, isolating it,
atomizing it, separating it from its own life, from itself and others
to
enslave it, while making it believe it is free via mass mind control,
nefarious protocols, pharmacopoeia and most of all FAKE ELECTIONS.
Cryptography's true purpose is to free us from each other on demand,
when we
mutually choose or not, to enhance individuals ability to decide their
own
fate, via 100% Privacy when desired with whom we choose to share it, to
exercise 100 % Freewill without ever inhibiting anyone else's ability
to do
the same as WE-R&copy;, Plural of I AM
WE-R&copy; : Wageless Economy Robotic&copy; http://goo.gl/WcMWo

Nov 13 2010: Cryptographic systems are often the purview, terrain &amp;
work of
SPOOKS, the very type of people who can by definition NEVER be trusted
with
anything, and MUST therefore be kept as far away from ELECTIONS as
possible
it turns out. They are mutually exclusive in fact, fatally incompatible
forever and ever,
so be it, so it is. We do however need white hat cryptographers to
explain to others WHY
computers can NEVER be suitable for ELECTIONS, and other computer
scientists
&amp; roboticists to explain what computers ARE good for, i.e.
hypothesizing,
extrapolating, visualizing scenarios, controlling robotic systems, but
NEVER
in the sacred process of ELECTING LEADERS, NEVER. With Wageless Economy
Robotic&copy;, we MUST have a way of determining what
people want for the robots to produce it, so the ability to accurately
collect these wishes from the public is key. Soon elections will not be
necessary, but until then it is vital they be
VALID so we get there.

getting them to ALMOST admit it, let us see... In fairness to them,
they may
just be front men, relying on those they front. Tried to save everyone
all
this pap, knowing what we KNOW to be TRUE, but as you say there is a
bigger
audience out there, so again bravo !!!
As you aptly state the "papers" all appeal to AUTHORITY, as if it can
some
how make lies true, when in REAL REALITY, TRUTH is AUTHORITY &amp; NOT
the other
way around.
Along your excellent observation that it always ends up an "appeal to
authority" as you so diplomatically put it, please consider that a
crypto
system like the one being suggested and ALL others are so weak in
reality
that in order to implement them an entire Military Command &amp;
Control Grid
overlay is REQUIRED, i.e. a POLICE STATE, and thus there is even more
reason
to doubt its results since no one can say anything under such
conditions,

This is known as the reverse ad hominem attack, and ignores the facts
both
that it did not occur and more importantly distracts from the REAL

David, please provide YOUR understanding of how DistKeyGen works.
Something
like this please easily LT 1000.
There is no largest prime number.

2 Let p denote the largest prime number.

Nov 13 2010: Furthermore, notice how the points themselves are never
addressed, only silence, but instead petty gripes of being insulted are
raised, as if words are more important than physical reality, this is
just
an extension of the tendency of some to live in a virtual world of
armored
narcissistic ego pods, while the real world goes to hell, this we MUST
address and if feather ruffling is necessary, so be it.
It matters not what is said against the truth, as it always is. Only
lies
need fear exposure.
Case in point is the FACT that Judges past election cycle, despite an
ubiquitous "THROW the BUMS OUT" mood were RETAINED 100 % of the time
with
outrageous 60/40 margins, this is simply audacious on someone's part,
they
are not even trying to look fair, this is how drunk on easy power the

Nov 13 2010: Roberto fails to see however that there have been ZERO

the
silence is a well known tactic in deception http://goo.gl/15fEE wherein
you
simply ignore, as if it does not exist, any dissent, especially those
that
hit the nail square through the board.
So while you others and they go back and forth on minutia that does not
matter in the least precisely because it all takes place in an already
substantiated dead zone, they only gain credibility as the body of
"research" grows, even this TED Blog, to be pointed at later as being
copious discussion which proves their point, i.e. this was discussed
thoroughly, here read this, as the travesty then gains acceptance as
'TRUTH'.

others, who isn't, in which case he is not completely responsible for
his

better, so he can salvage his good name and move on into building a
REAL
system which must be along these lines http://goo.gl/mq3zh, not one
that
will only be used to fully immerse most of humanity under an electronic

eliminate
the ability of the meek to exercise free will, while its architects run
away
with all that is good and right, which in the end is not right of

Nov 13 2010: Sir Richard, take your pick, they are either lying or

David
is not intentionally deceiving, as far as that can be determined from
watching a video. He appears to be what is known as a true believer,
when
all we are suggesting is that for something as serious as electing
leaders,
that belief &amp; faith is the last thing we should be relying on. It
must be
KNOWLEDGE, without tRUST of any kind. KNOWLEDGE MUST be TRUE to be
KNOWLEDGE. The same is not true of beLIEf, hence it, like tRUST, must
be
completely eliminated from systems where life and death are concerned.
Furthermore, there have been countless examples of priest classes of
depraved psycho-paths who have commandeered scribes to come up with
elaborate tales to justify the priest class' hidden masters' domination
over
others, and today is no exception: http://goo.gl/GN4D

Balderdash. Simply raising the bar of complexity to exclude those who
have not deceived
themselves into "believing" their "latest" religion is not an excuse to
create a new priest class of so called "experts".
Besides, this really is security thru obscurity, which means anyone who
can
figure it out can get in, we need something real, not just N+1 layers
of
complexity where N is the most recent, but not the latest hidden

Drew their swords and shot each other.
A Deaf Policeman heard the noise, came and killed the two dead boys.

David, please provide YOUR understanding of how DistKeyGen works. As
with
any concept, it is possible to prove a point in less than 1000
characters. Like this: There is no largest prime number.
Proof.
1 Suppose that there were only finitely many primes.
2 Let p denote the largest prime number.
3 Let q be the product of the series of primes up to p
4 Then q + 1 is not divisible by any in this series
5 Thus q + 1 is either prime GT p, or has a prime factor GT p.

Nov 12 2010: The "protocol" for creating the key shares is controlled
by
some nebulous, lurking unidentified entity, by clever design it turns
out,
not surprisingly. It wishes it had not just been mentioned in fact, but
is relying on most to
doubt its existence nevertheless, despite being told just now of its
existence and attempts to remain unnoticed.
Granted none of those who subject themselves to the protocol, but the
intentionally unnamed entity who subjects others to the "protocol" is
not
subject by definition, and necessarily, they would know the whole key,
there
is no way to prevent that. That information then becomes very valuable
and creates a cadre of insiders
who know it but tell everyone else they do not. This is how shadow
governments are created. Same as it ever was.
We cannot and must not trust anyone as being more entitled to anything.
Instead we should only use this very simple method that acknowledges
that we
are all equal as its very basis. http://goo.gl/mq3zh

that
you appear to be genuine, but you need to step back and ask yourself,
wouldn't it be even better to KNOW what you say is true ?
Granted all the "trusted" parties are lassoed into a system, but the
nebulous entity who is not, is still free to do whatever they want,
i.e. the
controller of the algorithms, the custodian of the system itself is
still
free to finagle behind the "process" which granted on the surface
appears to
be very strong, giving a false sense of security, due to the ALWAYS
possible
audacious END-RUN attack where you simply control the data itself that
everything else is run against, which would appear to produce VALID

to be "true" via "say so".
These very strengths of computers give us the fantastic ability to

requiring a priest class to "interpret" it and "explain" it, we already
have
too much of that, even more so when there is a very simple way that

Nov 12 2010: Hola Harald, are you even reading what you are writing ?
If there is no way to tell, then even the voter cannot be sure, is that
not
what you have just said ? Come on man, snap to.
Also, even if you do get a website to tell you who you cast your vote
for,
that does not mean it was totaled correctly, REMEMBER the TWO SETS of
BOOKS
Gambit that this scheme does NOT and CANNOT PREVENT simply because it,
like
ALL E-Voting Systems cannot, please people, do we really have to keep
reminding you of this ?
Besides if someone wants to buy votes, that is the choice of the
seller, we
cannot get into all that, FREE WILL is FREE WILL, that is the whole
point of
ELECTIONS, WE DECIDE WHO WE VOTE for, no one else. Does that make sense
to you sir ? The only PERFECT VOTING SYSTEM is Simple and here:

Nov 12 2010: Josh Josh Josh, look at what you have said, "...the
ability to
confirm your vote was counted, and counted correctly", have you the
wherewithal to see that E-Voting Systems in no way give you the ability
to
do that, they simply make FRAUD that much easier, no more need to get
in
there and fabricate physical evidence. Hackers are not the concern, it
is
those at top who are the biggest concern, the hacker is just a boogie
man to
blame and distract you from the super-criminals running the show.
Yet there actually is a perfect voting system contrary to what you have
stated, and it is simple as all perfect things are and is described

Like evil industrialists, there are good ones too, they simply spread
their

the FACT that no matter what pattern of bits you present as PROOF, it

It is JUST as self-evident to the awake that E-Voting Schemes are NOT

We have already clearly established to everyone RIGHT HERE, that ALL

that
are NOT in clear view at ALL TIMES to EVERYONE voting. A computer is
black box, meaning NO ONE can see inside it, it creates

Source code may or may not reflect the program running on a machine,
this

Nov 10 2010: Bismark continues to feign he wants to protect you, but
know
this, he is either intentionally deceiving you, or is very confused,
i.e.
blinded by the "science", best case scenario. For even knaves KNOW it
is NOT possible to secure E-Voting systems.
Perhaps Bismark has never been responsible for cash, and does not
understand
that it IS possible to create NO-TRUST SYSTEMS, which are ALWAYS
PHYSICAL in
nature. Think about the people who design casinos, bank vaults etc,
they
must trust no one, since no one can be trusted. No math is required,
only cold hard LOGIC, which while it can be conveyed to
others via a mathematical allegory, is nevertheless purely physical in
implementation and precisely why we cannot ever leave the physical and
tell
people we are "fail-safe"
The connection between physical &amp; virtual cannot be reversed,
virtual can
only describe physical, but can never BE IT.
All scams exploit knaves inability to understand this.

Challenge to ALL:
Those who control what you beLIEve to be nebulous, control you without
you
even knowing it: YET you, like them, can know, when you FREELY choose
to NOT
beLIEve, and choose to ONLY know, ALWAYS.
HOW YOU MUST FREELY CHOOSE TO RESPOND:
So do not be nebulous. Be very clear on what is and what is not and
never
can be.
Likewise, no one can deceive you except you. All deception is
self-deception, especially when you are NOT aware of it. Those who are
fully
awake see you fast asleep. Wise even warn you as your safety is theirs.
How
do you know you are in a dream ? Isn't it enough to simply ask ?
So be aware.
This is why you exist in fact, and the only thing that keeps you here

the living to forever keep you here whole.

Perspective Folks:
Thesis:
VR/Cyberspace can destroy REAL REALITY if we let mental defectives
control
its rollout.
Virtual Reality and cyberspace are valuable to humanity only when they
enhance REAL REALITY, not when they destroy it. If we allow CYBERSPACE
to suck REAL REALITY into it via E-Voting Schemes
which by definition can NEVER be secured precisely because they create
a
virtual reality where anything can be said to be true, whether it
matches
physical reality or not.
Mental Defectives are those who cannot differentiate between REAL
REALITY
which always contains VIRTUAL REALITY, and VIRTUAL REALITY which can
never
contain REAL REALITY, only represent it, since it is itself NOT
reality.
Just as the map is not the territory, nor the menu the meal.

This is because EVERY E-voting scheme REQUIRES TRUST.
There however is a way where NO ONE &amp; NO THING need be trusted, and
this my
friend is the NO-TEK solution that has been obfuscated for at least
10,000

given the same question will give different answers, besides the whole

else is

everything else in locked in as precincts are too big to steal only if

answer assumes
we are idiots, as it does not address the "DOUBLE SET of BOOKs" nor the

while still stealing the election. High Quality Fraud systems can even

all observations, all EXCEPT the all in one view afforded per precinct
as it
unfolds @ end of day with all voters present per this:

hence your need use it and to abandon all other methods. The reason
Bismark cannot address these issues is because it simply is not

There are 4 voters A B C D in precinct Z, for parties X &amp; Y. A B C
D vote for X. A has no clue who B C or D are or how they have voted.

this be done? Easily.
And 2. How would A know a fraud has been committed?
A doesn't know if the final count 1 for X &amp; 3 for Y is correct. He
only
knows how he has voted not how the others voted.
THUS the ONLY way to prevent this, is actually very simple. A B C D
from
precinct Z reconvene at days end TOGETHER to verify their votes have
been
counted correctly.
All precinct Z votes &amp; deli codes are displayed on a giant board

comment on Talk: David Bismark: E-voting without fraud
Nov 5 2010: What hope is there when there are so many fools that think
they
are smart... Yes any of you who entertain any sort of electronic voting
system whatsoever
are all fools, as you do not understand first principles. There is no
way to secure a system meant to tabulate the decisions of a
group of people unless that group of people does it themselves all at
once
on the spot, which of course is possible. No different than other
virtual problems like gold coin versus paper money.
Same thing.
First principle, you cannot trust anyone, especially those to whom you
have
given yours and your ability to take it back when they violate it.
There is plenty of hope when you read this: http://goo.gl/mq3zh

Nov 5 2010: This system requires trust. The only system which does not
is described here: http://goo.gl/mq3zh
This system can of course reveal to you who you voted for while still
doing
whatever it wants with the totals. Anyone who cannot understand this
should not be in charge of cash or in
charge of systems to prevent theft of cash. It is so simple that all
you
over educated fools cannot see it, but know that criminals can
understand
this.

Nov 4 2010: SCREW so called "experts", we are all experts now, besides
this
is common-sense, why are you complicating it &amp; creating tiers of
people ?
Lords &amp; the Lorded.
E-VOTING IS, IS, IS FRAUD
E-VOTING does not bring people together, it keeps them apart.
The big lie technique is very much still in practice.
Saying E-VOTING BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER IS A FOUL LIE that you try to
lead
your talk with to spin your listeners into &amp; you know it.
OPEN SOURCE, TRANSPARENT, you have got to be kidding us, what about the
parts we cannot see ? If ALL cannot see ALL parts, it only takes the
one part that we cannot see
EVERYTIME it is used, to break your notion of 'open' source, that is
why
there can be no computers whatsoever between us &amp; each other for
this sacred
process of elections. You really are straining the borders of chicanery
if you expect anyone but
the most gullible to trust you.

It must be a process where EVERYONE sees everything as it really is,

is SIMPLE and LOW TECH and requires a whole day to do per precinct with

Nov 2 2010: BOGUS: The only way to verify a physical vote is to have
everyone who voted to view a single physical board per precinct with
all the
votes cast displayed with a code next to each vote that each voter will
be
able to view and acknowledge, or deny, that indeed that is how they
voted by
matching it with the code they received when they cast their votes,
without
of course revealing who they voted for, yes all of them must be present
at
the same time, with no one dissenting, which can be done on a precinct
by
precinct basis. There can be no electronics involved of any kind, none.
There simply is no other way, and yes it is as simple as this.
As for logistics, voting is that important, that it must be an entire
day
off, that is the least we can do for something this important, alas
they
know this too, and do not really what to hear what you really think.

comment on Talk: Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren
Mar 27 2008: Jose Tavares: Thanks for your cogent description of
religion generically... I would like to agree with you on the generics
and also delve deeper into
the historical application of these generics as described below in my
post,
wherein it was discussed how the Roman Empire attempted to apply your
generics in the destruction of the only civilization to not bend its
knee to
the Roman Juggernaut, and that in order to destroy Judaism, they
parasitically attached a new religion to Judaism, forged it to appear
as a
natural progression from it, via the Jesus Story, and that as a result,
they
not only attempted to steal the power of Judaism, they also created a
huge
force that produced billions of robotic humans to toil endlessly
generation
after generation, essentially throwaway disposable people, and that as
a
result, we are delaying the advent of REAL LIFE EVERLASTING BEFORE
DEATH,
via the Emancipation of Humanity from the Machinery of Economy through
the
REAL ROBOTIC WAGELESS ECONOMY - http://RoboEco.com/ttenned
And that moreover, the bullies who have coasted on this easy system of
domination of humans will never stop unless we intelligently
transition, and
ironically are preventing themselves from living forever BEFORE death,
because of their addiction to the ill gotten easy spoils of the current
system.
Cheers Jose Tavares, thanks for writing.

comment on Talk: Richard Dawkins on militant atheism
Mar 27 2008: Just because most religions are false does not mean all
are..........
You existence proves everything you need to know, i.e. why is there not
just
nothing ?
You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
terms
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether
it is
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.
That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go
back
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
should be
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The
Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first, it
goes
without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could
argue
with as not being virtuous.
This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so
we
are not taken for fools forever.
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
highest
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what
do you
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
exploitation of
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating
"holding
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still
people
"naively" "debate" it.
What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?
Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity is
an
effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
catatonic/robotic
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
people
get on with ruling in "reality" ?
If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion
that
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
bend the
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via
the
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
dogma
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
conquering
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
bully's
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?
Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,
what do
you expect for its adherents ?
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.
This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also
seems
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.
Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is
very
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman
Empire,
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?
If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the
same
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations
sacrifice,
correct ?
Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense
?
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?
Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?
Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on
the
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my
assertions
false, they must be true !???
Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know
the
context.
The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?
Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for
intentional
sins in any case. Study friend, study.
Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and
Eve's
sins.
It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for
their
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not
questioning the
framework itself.
Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not
surprisingly, exploitative.
Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way
around,
agreed ?
We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we
really
get that upset about them ripping people off ?
We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep
in
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT
Christians,
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we
know
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built
on
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered
Jewish
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today
notwithstanding.
In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like
an
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
Rabbi
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org
and
Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures
We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews
for
Jesus FrankenFaith.
Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers
as
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole
deal,
and who is there to argue with you ?
If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.
At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying
to
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short,
and
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
Scriptures
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for
starters.
Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's
sins
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!
Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of
accounting and
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of
truth
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be
manipulated at will.
Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
millions of
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age
of
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once
and
for ALL !!!

dogma
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
conquering
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
bully's
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?
Have you not read Tacitus ? The guile expressed in Tacitus is simply
stunning, and the literary skill is truly genius.
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, executed by the state, human,
what do
you expect for its adherents ?
What happened to G-d is G-d with no name ?
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever.
Rick, thank you for being studious and interested in the truth in all
things.
This is a response I posted to E.J. Dione's recent talk, which also
seems
appropriate here with some modification and specifically this preface.
Isn't it interesting that the notion of sacrificing one's son[s] is
very
important and central to Growing Military Regimes like the Roman
Empire,
from whence Christianity came after Rome sacked Jerusalem?
If G-d could sacrifice his son, who are you to not be willing to do the
same
? However G-d does not sacrifice, does he ? ...Only his creations
sacrifice,
correct ?
Would G-d ever sacrifice to please himself ? Does that even make sense
?
Could G-d sacrifice himself and still be here ?
Does any of this make the slightest bit of sense ?
Couldn't anyone come up with equally baffling ideas and just lean on
the
"unfalsifiable assumption" and say, hey since you cannot prove my
assertions
false, they must be true !???
Debating stories like Alice and Wonderland is fine as long as you know
the
context.
The notion of Human Sacrifice was unheard of in Jewish Scripture and
strictly prohibited, remember Moloch ?
Blood sacrifice was NEVER mandatory, and could never be used for
intentional
sins in any case. Study friend, study.
Ezekiel Chapter 18 CLEARLY indicates we are not responsible for other
peoples sins, i.e. our parents sins or their parents sins, or Adam and
Eve's
sins.
It is understandable that once within a certain paradigm, one who never
questions the premises of that paradigm cannot be held responsible for
their
"correct" decisions within the false framework, only for not
questioning the
framework itself.
Isn't the main problem with Christianity is that it is false and not
surprisingly, exploitative.
Christianity CAN be false and Judaism true, but not the other way
around,
agreed ?
We fault the evangelists, but if the faith itself is false, can we
really
get that upset about them ripping people off ?
We do not need to get into the specifics of why it is false, but keep
in
mind the 800 pound gorilla, i.e. that Jews by definition are NOT
Christians,
and who better to know whether Christianity is a false religion when we
know
our scriptures better than anyone and Christianity is supposedly built
on
our scriptures, but in no case can be shown to be, using untampered
Jewish
Scriptures that is, all claims by early Church fathers up to today
notwithstanding.
In fact it easy to show Christianity was painted into scriptures like
an
archer painting bullseyes around previously shot arrows. Please see
Rabbi
Tovia Singer's excellent lectures: http://www.outreachjudaism.org
and
Rabbi Tovia's MP3 lectures
We like to act as if this is not a fact, i.e. that Jews 100% reject
Christianity, but it is a fact by definition, notwithstanding the Jews
for
Jesus FrankenFaith.
Evangelicals are not deceiving anyone when they address their followers
as
BELIEVERS, i.e. if you believe, then you have signed up for the whole
deal,
and who is there to argue with you ?
If Christianity is false, then there is no good version of it.
At its core is a belief that people are basically evil garbage from the
start, all the way back to the beginning, i.e. that we are all trying
to
gain entrance to a $1 movie, and all of us are at least 55 cents short,
and
that someone else has to pay the balance. Of course our Jewish
Scriptures
say no such nonsense throughout, please read Ezekiel Chapter 18 for
starters.
Furthermore, Christianity states that you are guilty for someone else's
sins
!, and what is even crazier, that someone else can pay for your sins!
Both these beliefs are insidiously destructive to a system of accounting
and
culpability, effectively destroying the beauty of the Jewish system of
truth
and responsibility, encouraging incredible hypocrisy and insanity,
effectively reducing the human entity to a formula that can be
manipulated at will.
Instead of trying to salvage an obvious fraud that has consumed
millions of
lives and continues to poison the minds of billions, why not look @ the
coming Inevitable "Robotic Wageless Economy" which will usher in an Age
of
Recreation by emancipating humanity from the machinery of economy once
and
for ALL !!!

comment on Talk: Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren
Mar 26 2008: Dan:
You are correct that the Christian Right has done a ton of damage in
terms
of destroying common sense etc, but neither side really knows whether
it is
Creationism or Evolution or a combination or neither.
That is NOT the issue, and the oppressors only gain strength when we go
back
in forth forever in simple polarity swapping, when the real focus
should be
on not revenge, but a way where everyone wins, i.e. the rollout of "The
Inevitable Robotic Wageless Economy", more on that below, but first, it
goes
without saying that the attributes ascribed to Jesus, no one could
argue
with as not being virtuous.
This much is obvious. But let us look at what is not so obvious too so
we
are not taken for fools forever.
If your G-d is a tortured, humiliated, state executed human of the
highest
possible virtue from the targeted previous culture and religion, what
do you
expect for the adherents of the "new supplanting/conquering" religion?
Pure state sponsored literary genius!! Breathtakingly clever
exploitation of
Altruism for 2000 years and running keeping us in a devastating
"holding
pattern" permitting moronic bullies to rule in leisure !! What a
meat-grinder !!! The devil would be proud indeed !!! ...and still
people
"naively" "debate" it.
What ever happened to G-d is G-d with no pronounceable name ?
Couple of thoughts have come to mind. Could it be that Christianity is
an
effective tool to reduce expectations of the essentially
catatonic/robotic
masses of pseudo-people, to "facilitate" suffering, while the "real"
people
get on with ruling in "reality" ?
If you worship a literary creation that was Tortured to Death by a
conquering empire who also attempted to destroy the people and religion
that
this literary figure purportedly came from, the only culture to not
bend the
knee, and this new religion then was controlled by and articulated via
the
same conquering empire, even has a book named after them in the new
dogma
called ROMANS, declaring the old dogma to be "null and void", a
conquering
empire exhibiting unspeakable barbarism, what can you expect but a
bully's
religion excelling in telling the biggest lie of all time, extending
suffering forever unless checked once and for all?
