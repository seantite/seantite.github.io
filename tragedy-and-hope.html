          </span>TRAGEDY AND HOPE is a lively, informed and always
          readable view<br>
          of our not quite One World of today, seen in historical
          perspective.<br>
          Quigley has already shown his command of the kind of
          historical<br>
          perspective seen in the a world like that of Toynbee and
          Spengler; but<br>
          unlike them he does not so much concern himself with
          projections from<br>
          a distant past to a distant future as he does with what must
          interest<br>
          us all much more closely - our own future and that of our
          immediate<br>
          descendants. He uses the insights, but in full awareness of
          the<br>
          limitations of our modern social sciences, and especially
          those of<br>
          economics, sociology, and psychology. Not all readers will
          agree with<br>
          what he sees ahead of us in the near future, nor with what he
          thinks<br>
          we should do about it. But all will find this provocative and<br>
          sometimes provoking book a stimulus to profitable reflection.<br>

            TRAGEDY AND HOPE </span>shows the years 1895-1950 as a
          period of<br>
          transition from the world dominated by Europe in the
          nineteenth<br>
          century to the world of three blocs in the twentieth century.
          With<br>
          clarity, perspective and cumulative impact, Professor Quigley
          examines<br>
          the nature of that transition through two world wars and a
          worldwide<br>
          economic depression. As an interpretative historian, he tries
          to show<br>
          &nbsp;(1 of 129)<br>
          each event in the full complexity of its historical context.
          The<br>
          result is a unique work, notable in several ways. It gives a
          picture<br>
          of the world in terms of the influence of different cultures
          and<br>
          outlooks upon each other; it shows, more completely than in
          any<br>
          similar work, the influence of science and technology on human
          life;<br>
          and it explains, with unprecedented clarity, how the intricate<br>
          financial and commercial patterns of the West prior to 1914
          influenced<br>
          the development of today's world.<br>

          </span>Each civilization is born in some inexplicable fashion
          and, after<br>
          a slow start, enters a period of vigorous expansion,
          increasing its<br>
          size and power, both internally and at the expense of its
          neighbors,<br>
          until gradually a crisis of organization appears... It becomes<br>
          stabilized and eventually stagnant. After a Golden Age of
          peace and<br>
          prosperity, internal crises again arise. At this point, there
          appears<br>
          for the first time, a moral and physical weakness.<span

          The passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict
          is<br>
          the most complex, most interesting and most critical of all
          periods of<br>
          the life cycle of a civilization. It is marked by four chief<br>
          characteristics: it is a period:<br>
          <br>
          a) of declining rate of expansion;<br>
          <br>
          b) of growing tensions and class conflicts;<br>
          <br>
          c) of increasingly frequent and violent imperialist wars;<br>
          <br>
          d) of growing irrationality.<br>
          <br>

          When we consider the untold numbers of other societies,
          simpler<br>
          than civilizations, which Western Civilization has destroyed
          or is now<br>
          destroying, the full frightening power of Western Civilization
          becomes<br>
          obvious.<br>
          This shift from an Age of Conflict to an Age of Expansion is<br>
          marked by a resumption of the investment of capital and the<br>
          accumulation of capital on a large scale.<br>
          In the new Western civilization, a small number of men,
          equipped<br>
          and trained to fight, received dues and services from the
          overwhelming<br>

          inequitable but effective defensive system emerged an
          inequitable<br>
          distribution of political power and, in turn, an inequitable<br>
          distribution of the social economic income. This, in time,
          resulted in<br>
          an accumulation of capital, which, by giving rise to demand
          for luxury<br>
          goods of remote origin, began to shift the whole economic
          emphasis of<br>
          the society from its earlier organization in self-sufficient
          agrarian<br>
          units to commercial interchange, economic specialization, and,
          a<br>
          bourgeois class.<br>

          At the end of the first period of expansion of Western<br>
          Civilization covering the years 970-1270, the organization of
          society<br>
          was becoming a petrified collection of vested interests and
          entered<br>
          the Age of Conflict from 1270-1420.<br>
          <br>
          In the new Age of Expansion, frequently called the period of<br>
          commercial capitalism from 1440 to 1680, the real impetus to
          economic<br>
          expansion came from efforts to obtain profits by the
          interchange of<br>
          goods, especially semi-luxury or luxury goods, over long
          distances. In<br>
          time, profits were sought by imposing restrictions on the
          production<br>
          or interchange of goods rather than by encouraging these
          activities.<br>

          The social organization of this third Age of Expansion from
          1770-<br>
          1929 following upon the second Age of Conflict of 1690-1815
          might be<br>
          called "industrial capitalism." In the last of the nineteenth
          century,<br>
          it began to become a structure of vested interests to which we
          might<br>
          give the name "monopoly capitalism."<br>
          We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the
          United<br>
          States will rule most of the Western Civilization. This will
          be<br>
          followed, as in other civilizations, by a period of decay and<br>
          ultimately, as the civilizations grows weaker, by invasions
          and the<br>
          total destruction of Western culture.<br>

          The belief in the innate goodness of man had its roots in the<br>
          eighteenth century when it appeared to many that man was born
          good and<br>
          free but was everywhere distorted, corrupted, and enslaved by
          bad<br>
          institutions and conventions. As Rousseau said, "Man is born
          free yet<br>
          everywhere he is in chains."<br>
          Obviously, if man is is innately good and needs but to be
          freed<br>
          from social restrictions, he is capable of tremendous
          achievements in<br>
          this world of time, and does not need to postpone his hopes of<br>
          personal salvation into eternity.<br>
          <br>
          Page 25<br>
          <br>
          To the nineteenth century mind, evil, or sin, was a negative<br>
          conception. It merely indicated a lack or, at most, a
          distortion of<br>
          good. Any idea of sin or evil as a malignant force opposed to
          good,<br>
          and capable of existing by its own nature, was completely
          lacking in<br>
          the typical nineteenth century mind. The only evil was
          frustration and<br>
          the only sin, repression.<br>
          <br>
          Just as the negative idea of the nature of evil flowed from
          the<br>
          belief that human nature was good, so the idea of liberalism
          flowed<br>
          from the belief that society was bad. For, if society was
          bad,the<br>
          state,which was the organized coercive power of society, was
          doubly<br>
          bad, and if man was good, he should be freed, above all, from
          the<br>
          coercive power of the state.<br>
          <br>
          "No government in business" was commonly called "laissez
          faire"<br>
          and would have left society with little power beyond that
          required to<br>
          prevent the strong from physically oppressing the weak.<br>
          This strange, and unexamined, belief held that there really<br>
          existed, in the long run, a "community of interests" between
          the<br>
          &nbsp;(3 of 129)<br>
          <br>
          members of a society. It maintained that, in the long run,
          what was<br>
          good for one was bad for all. It believed that there did exist
          a<br>
          possible social pattern in which each member would be secure,
          free and<br>
          prosperous.<br>

          Capitalism was an economic system in which the motivating
          force<br>
          was the desire for private profit as determined in a price
          system with<br>
          the seeking of aggrandization of profits for each individual.<br>
          Nationalism served to bind persons of the same nationality<br>
          together into a tight, emotionally satisfying, unit. On the
          other<br>
          side, it served to divide persons of different nationalities
          into<br>
          antagonistic groups, often to the injury of their real mutual<br>
          political, economic or cultural advantages.<br>
          The event which destroyed the pretty dream world of 1919-1929<br>
          were the stock market crash, the world depression, the world
          financial<br>
          crisis.<br>

          <br>
          The twentieth century came to believe that human nature is, if<br>
          not innately bad, at least capable of being very evil. Left to<br>
          himself, man falls very easily to the level of the jungle or
          even<br>
          lower and this result can be prevent only by the coercive
          power of<br>
          society. Along with this change from good men and bad society
          to bad<br>
          men and good society has appeared a reaction from optimism to<br>
          pessimism. The horrors of Hitler's concentration camps and
          Stalin's<br>
          slave-labor units are chiefly responsible for this change.<br>

          The financial capitalist sought profits from the manipulation
          of<br>
          claims on money; and the monopoly capitalist sought profits
          from<br>
          manipulation of the market to make the market price and the
          amount<br>
          sold such that his profits would be maximized.<br>

          Karl Marx,about 1850, formed his ideas of an inevitable class<br>
          struggle in which the groups of owners would become fewer and
          fewer<br>
          and richer and richer while the mass of workers became poorer
          and<br>
          poorer but more and more numerous.<br>
          Mass production required less labor. But mass production
          required<br>
          mass consumption.<br>

          Investments in railroads, steel mills and so on could not be<br>
          financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual<br>
          proprietors. New instruments for financing industry came into<br>
          existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and
          investment<br>
          banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief
          parts of the<br>
          industrial system since they provided the capital to it. This
          gave<br>
          rise to financial capitalism.<br>
          <br>
          Page 43<br>
          <br>
          Great industrial units, working together either directly or<br>
          through cartels and trade associations, were in a position to
          exploit<br>
          the majority of the people. The result was a great economic
          crisis<br>
          which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state
          - the<br>
          minority hoping to use the state to defend their privileged
          position,<br>
          the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and<br>
          privileges of the minority.<br>
          Capitalism, because it seems profits as its primary goal, is<br>
          never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high
          production, high<br>
          &nbsp;(4 of 129)<br>
          consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral
          uplift.<br>
          <br>
          Page 44<br>
          <br>
          Goods moved from low-price areas to high-price areas and money<br>
          moved from high-price areas to low-price areas because goods
          were more<br>
          valuable where prices were high and money was more valuable
          where<br>
          prices were low.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are,
          on<br>
          the contrary, exactly opposite things. Most confusion in
          economic<br>
          thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. Goods are
          wealth<br>
          which you have, while money is a claim on wealth which you do
          not<br>
          have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt. If goods are
          wealth;<br>
          money is non-wealth, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth.<br>
          <br>
          Page 45<br>
          <br>
          In time, some merchants turned their attention from exchange
          of<br>
          goods to the monetary side of the exchange. They became
          concerned with<br>
          the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and
          their<br>
          activities, advancing money for both, at high interest rates,
          secured<br>
          by claims on ships or goods as collateral for repayment and
          made it<br>
          possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the
          process and,<br>
          by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest.<br>

          Three parts of the system, production, transfer, and
          consumption<br>
          of goods were concrete and clearly visible so that almost
          anyone could<br>
          grasp them simply examining them while the operations of
          banking and<br>
          finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they
          appeared<br>
          to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves
          did<br>
          everything they could to make their activities more secret and
          more<br>
          esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks
          in<br>
          ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider.<br>
          Changes of prices, whether inflationary or deflationary, have<br>
          been major forces in history for the last six centuries at
          least.<br>

          Page 47<br>
          <br>
          Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with
          richer<br>
          and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign
          trade<br>
          and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and
          more<br>
          cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of
          political<br>
          significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies,
          war and<br>
          peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies,
          they<br>
          became financiers and financial advisers of governments.
          Moreover,<br>
          they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary
          exchanges and<br>
          used their power and influence to do two things:<br>
          <br>
          1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of strictly
          limited<br>
          commodity - ultimately gold; and<br>
          <br>
          2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of
          governments and<br>
          political authority, on the ground that they would be handled
          better<br>
          by private banking interests in terms of such a stable value
          of gold.<br>

          <br>

          <br>
          Britain's victories had many causes such as its ability to<br>
          control the sea and its ability to present itself to the world
          as the<br>
          defender of the freedoms and rights of small nations and of
          diverse<br>
          social and religious groups. Also, financially, England had
          discovered<br>
          the secret of credit and economically, it had embarked on the<br>
          Industrial Revolution.<br>
          <br>
          Credit had been known to the Italians and Netherlanders long<br>
          before it became one of the instruments of English world
          supremacy.<br>
          Nevertheless, the founding of the Bank of England by William
          Paterson<br>
          and his friends in 1694 is one of the great dates in world
          history.<br>
          For generations, men had sought to avoid the one drawback of
          gold, its<br>
          heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific
          pieces of<br>
          gold. Today, we call such pieces of paper gold certificates
          which<br>
          &nbsp;(5 of 129)<br>
          <br>
          entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece of gold on
          demand, but<br>
          in view of the convenience of paper, only a small fraction of<br>
          certificate holders ever did make such demands. It early
          became clear<br>
          that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to
          cover the<br>
          fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment;<br>
          accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business
          purposes,<br>
          or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates
          could be<br>
          issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of
          demands<br>
          against them. such an excess volume of paper claims against
          reserves<br>
          we now call bank notes.<br>
          <br>
          In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the<br>
          reserves available means that bankers were creating money out
          of<br>
          nothing. The same thing could be done in another way, not by
          note issuing<br>
          banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that<br>
          orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and
          given to<br>
          third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were
          deposited<br>
          to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of
          funds,<br>
          and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on
          the<br>
          accounts. Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep
          on hand<br>
          in actual money (gold, certificates and notes) no more than
          the<br>
          fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon and cashed; the
          rest<br>
          could be used for loans and if these loans were made by
          creating a<br>
          deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon
          it rather<br>
          than withdraw it in money, such "created deposits" or loans
          could also<br>
          be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction
          of<br>
          their value. Such created deposits also were a creation of
          money out<br>
          of nothing, although bankers usually refused to express their
          actions,<br>
          either note issuing or deposit lending, in these terms.
          William<br>
          Paterson, on obtaining the charter of the Bank of England,
          said "the<br>
          Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys it creates out of<br>
          nothing." This is generally admitted today.<br>
          <br>
          This organizational structure for creating means of payment
          out<br>
          of nothing, which we call credit, was not invented by England
          but was<br>
          developed by her to become one of her chief weapons in the
          victory<br>
          over Napoleon in 1815. The emperor, could not see money in any
          but<br>
          concrete terms, and was convinced that his efforts to fight
          wars on<br>
          the basis of "sound money" by avoiding the creation of credit,
          would<br>
          ultimately win him a victory by bankrupting England. He was
          wrong<br>
          although the lesson has had to be relearned by modern
          financiers in<br>
          the twentieth century.<br>

          The third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming<br>
          significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its<br>
          ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and
          even<br>
          occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate
          attention to<br>
          this organization and methods.<br>
          <br>
          Essentially, what it did was to take the old disorganized and<br>
          localized methods of handling money and credit and organize
          them into<br>
          an integrated system, on an international basis, which worked
          with<br>
          incredible and well-oiled facility for many decades. The
          center of<br>
          that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York
          and Paris<br>
          and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated
          banking<br>
          system and a heavily capitalized - if now largely obsolescent
          -<br>
          framework of heavy industry, reflected in railroads, steel
          mills, coal<br>
          mines and electrical utilities.<br>
          <br>
          This system had its center in London for four chief reasons.<br>
          First was the great volume of savings in England. Second was
          England's<br>
          oligarchic social structure which provided a very inequitable<br>
          distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the
          control of<br>
          &nbsp;(6 of 129)<br>
          a small, energetic upper class. Third was that this upper
          class was<br>
          aristocratic but not noble, quite willing to recruit both
          money and<br>
          ability from lower levels and even from outside the country,
          welcoming<br>
          American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks
          almost as<br>
          willingly as it welcomed monied, able and conformist recruits
          from the<br>
          lower classes of Englishmen. Fourth (and by no means last) in<br>
          significance was the skill in financial manipulation,
          especially on<br>
          the international scene, which the small group of merchant
          bankers of<br>
          London had acquired.<br>
          <br>
          In time, they brought into their financial network the
          provincial<br>
          banking centers as well as insurance companies to form all of
          these<br>
          into a single financial system on an international scale which<br>
          manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were
          able to<br>
          influence, if not control, governments on one side and
          industries on<br>
          the other.<br>
          <br>
          The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of<br>
          dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired
          to<br>
          establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least
          as<br>
          successful at this as were many of the dynastic political
          rulers. The<br>
          greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants
          of Meyer<br>
          Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) whose male descendants for at
          least two<br>
          generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces.<br>
          Rothschild's five sons, established at branches in Vienna,
          London,<br>
          Naples and Paris as well as Frankfort, cooperated together in
          ways<br>
          which other international banking dynasties copied but rarely<br>
          excelled.<br>
          <br>
          In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic<br>
          activities of international bankers, we must not totally
          ignore their<br>
          other attributes. They were cosmopolitan rather than
          nationalistic;<br>
          they were a constant, if weakening, influence for peace, a
          pattern<br>
          established in 1830 and 1840 when the Rothschilds threw their
          whole<br>
          tremendous influence successfully against European wars.<br>
          They were usually highly civilized, cultured gentlemen,
          patrons<br>
          of education and of the arts, so that today, colleges,
          professorships,<br>
          opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections
          still<br>
          reflect their munificence. For these purposes they set a
          pattern of<br>
          endowed foundations which still surround us today.<br>
          <br>
          The names of some of these banking families are familiar to
          all<br>
          of us and should be more so. They include Baring, Lazard,
          Erlanger,<br>
          Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould
          and<br>
          above all Rothschild and Morgan. Even after these banking
          families<br>
          became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of<br>
          financial capitalism, they remained different from ordinary
          bankers in<br>
          distinctive ways:<br>
          <br>
          1) they were cosmopolitan and international;<br>
          <br>
          2) they were close to governments and were particularly
          concerned with<br>
          questions of government debts, including foreign government
          debts,<br>
          even in areas which seemed, at first glance, poor risks, like
          Egypt,<br>
          Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Imperial China and Latin America;<br>
          <br>
          3) their interests were almost exclusively in bonds and very
          rarely in<br>
          goods since they admired "liquidity";<br>
          <br>
          4) they were fanatical devotees of deflation (which they
          called<br>
          "sound" money from its close association with high interest
          rates and<br>
          a high value of money) and of the gold standard;<br>
          <br>
          5) they were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret
          use of<br>
          financial influence in political life. These bankers came to
          be called<br>
          "international bankers" and were known as "merchant bankers"
          in<br>
          England, "private bankers" in France and "investment bankers"
          in the<br>
          United States.<br>
          <br>
          Everywhere, they were sharply distinguishable from other, more<br>
          &nbsp;(7 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or commercial
          banks.<br>
          One of their less obvious characteristics was that they
          remained<br>
          as private unincorporated firms offering no shares, no
          reports, and<br>
          usually no advertising to the public until modern inheritance
          taxes<br>
          made it essential to surround such family wealth with the
          immortality<br>
          of corporate status for tax-avoidance purposes. This
          persistence as<br>
          private firms continued because it ensured the maximum of
          anonymity<br>
          and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded
          public<br>
          knowledge of their activities as an evil almost as great as
          inflation.<br>
          <br>
          Page 53<br>
          <br>
          Firms like Morgan, like others of the international banking<br>
          fraternity, constantly operated through corporations and
          governments,<br>
          yet remained itself an obscure private partnership.<br>
          <br>
          The influence of financial capitalism and the international<br>
          bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on<br>
          governments, but could have neither if it had not been able to<br>
          persuade both these to accept two "axioms" of its own
          ideology. Both<br>
          of these were based on the assumption that politicians were
          too weak<br>
          and too subject to temporary public pressures to be trusted
          with<br>
          control of the money system; accordingly, the soundness of
          money must<br>
          be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold
          and by<br>
          allowing bankers to control the money supply. To do this it
          was<br>
          necessary to conceal, even mislead, both governments and
          people about<br>
          the nature of money and its methods of operation.<br>
          <br>
          Page 54<br>
          <br>
          Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the<br>
          twentieth century without some understanding of the role
          played by<br>
          money in domestic affairs and in foreign affairs, as well as
          the role<br>
          played by bankers in economic life and in political life, we
          must take<br>
          a least a glance at each of these four subjects:<br>
          <br>
          DOMESTIC FINANCIAL PRACTICES<br>
          <br>
          In each country, the supply of money took the form of an
          inverted<br>
          pyramid or cone balanced on its point. In the point was the
          supply of<br>
          gold and its equivalent certificates; on the intermediate
          levels was a<br>
          much larger supply of notes; and at the top, with an open and<br>
          expandable upper surface, was an even greater supply of
          deposits. Each<br>
          level used the levels below it as its reserves and these lower
          levels<br>
          had smaller quantities of money, they were "sounder."<br>
          <br>
          Notes were issued by "banks of emission" or "banks of issue"
          and<br>
          were secured by reserves of gold or certificates held in some
          central<br>
          reserve. The fraction held in reserve depended upon banking<br>
          regulations or statute law. Such banks, even central banks,
          were<br>
          private institutions, owned by shareholders who profited by
          their<br>
          operations.<br>
          <br>
          Deposits on the upper level of the pyramid were called by this<br>
          name, with typical bankers' ambiguity, in spite of the fact
          that they<br>
          consisted of two utterly different kinds of relationships:<br>
          <br>
          1) "lodged deposits" which were real claims left by a
          depositor in a<br>
          bank on which a depositor might receive interest; and<br>
          <br>
          2) "created deposits" which were claims created by the bank
          out of<br>
          nothing as loans from the bank to "depositors" who had to pay
          interest<br>
          on them.<br>
          <br>
          Both form part of the money supply. Lodged deposits as a form
          of<br>
          savings are deflationary while created deposits, being an
          addition to<br>
          the money supply, are inflationary.<br>
          <br>
          Page 55<br>
          <br>
          The volume of deposits banks can create, like the amount of
          notes<br>
          they can issue, depends upon the volume of reserves available
          to pay<br>
          whatever fraction of checks are cashed rather than deposited.
          In the<br>
          United States, deposits were traditionally limited to ten
          times<br>
          reserves notes and gold. In Britain it was usually nearer
          twenty times<br>
          &nbsp;(8 of 129) <br>
          such reserves. In most countries, the central bank was
          surrounded<br>
          closely by the almost invisible private investment banking
          firms.<br>
          These, like the planet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the
          dazzle<br>
          emitted by the central bank, which they, in fact, often
          dominated. Yet<br>
          a lost observer could hardly fail to notice the close private<br>
          associations between these private, international bankers and
          the<br>
          central bank itself. In France, in 1936, the Board of the Bank
          of<br>
          France was still dominated by the names of the families who
          had<br>
          originally set it up in 1800.<br>
          <br>
          In England, a somewhat similar situation existed. In a
          secondary<br>
          ring are the "joint stock banks." Outside this secondary ring
          are the<br>
          savings banks, insurance firms, and trust companies.<br>
          In France and England the private bankers exercised their
          powers<br>
          through the central bank and had much more influence on the
          government<br>
          and foreign policy and less on industry. In the United States,
          much<br>
          industry was financed by investment bankers directly and the
          power of<br>
          these both on industry and government was very great.<br>
          <br>
          Page 57<br>
          <br>
          The various parts of the pyramid of money were but loosely<br>
          related to each other. Much of this looseness arose from the
          fact that<br>
          the controls were compulsive in a deflationary direction and
          were only<br>
          permissive in an inflationary direction. This last point can
          be seen<br>
          in the fact that the supply of gold could be decreased but
          could<br>
          hardly be increased. If an ounce of gold was added to the
          point of the<br>
          pyramid, it could permit an increase in deposits equivalent to
          $2067<br>
          on the uppermost level. If such an ounce of gold were
          withdrawn from a<br>
          fully expanded pyramid of money, this would compel a reduction
          of<br>
          deposits by at least this amount, probably by a refusal to
          renew<br>
          loans.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout modern history, the influence of the gold standard
          has<br>
          been deflationary, because the natural output of gold each
          year,<br>
          except in extraordinary times, has not kept pace with the
          increase in<br>
          the output of goods. Only new supplies of gold or the
          development of<br>
          new kinds of money have saved our civilization over the last
          couple of<br>
          centuries. The three great periods of war ended with an
          extreme<br>
          deflationary crisis (1819, 1873, 1921) as the influential
          Money Power<br>
          persuaded governments to re-establish a deflationary monetary
          unit<br>
          with a high gold content.<br>
          <br>
          The obsession of the Money Power with deflation was partly a<br>
          result of their concern with money rather than with goods but
          was also<br>
          founded on other factors, one of which was paradoxical. The
          paradox<br>
          arose from the fact that the basic economic conditions of the<br>
          nineteenth century were deflationary, with a monetary system
          based on<br>
          gold and an industrial system pouring out increasing supplies
          of goods<br>
          but in spite of falling prices, the interest rate tended to
          fall<br>
          rather than rise. Moreover, merchant banking continued to
          emphasize<br>
          bonds rather than equity securities (stocks), to favor
          government<br>
          issues rather than private offerings.<br>
          <br>
          Another paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that<br>
          bankers, who loved deflation, often acted in an inflationary
          fashion<br>
          from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they
          make money<br>
          out of loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank
          credit on<br>
          loan. But this is inflationary. The conflict between the
          deflationary<br>
          ideas and inflationary practices of bankers had profound
          repercussions<br>
          on business. The bankers made loans to business so that the
          volume of<br>
          money increased faster than the increase of goods. The result
          was<br>
          inflation. When this became clearly noticeable, the bankers
          would flee<br>
          to notes or specie by curtailing credit and raising discount
          rates.<br>
          This was beneficial to the bankers in the short run (since it
          allowed<br>
          them to foreclose on collateral for loans) but it could be
          disastrous<br>
          &nbsp;(9 of 129) <br>
          to them in the long run (by forcing the value of the
          collateral below<br>
          the amount of the loans it secured). But such bankers'
          deflation was<br>
          destructive to business and industry in the short run as well
          as the<br>
          long run.<br>
          <br>
          Page 59<br>
          <br>
          The resulting fluctuation in the supply of money, chiefly<br>
          deposits, was a prominent aspect of the "business cycle." The
          quantity<br>
          of money could be changed by changing reserve requirements or
          discount<br>
          (interest) rates. Central banks can usually vary the amount of
          money<br>
          in circulation by "open market operations" or by influencing
          the<br>
          discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a
          central<br>
          bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market. If it
          buys, it<br>
          releases money into the economic system; it if sells it
          reduces the<br>
          amount of money in the community. If the Federal Reserve Bank
          buys, it<br>
          pays for these by checks which are soon deposited in a bank.
          It thus<br>
          increases this bank's reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank.
          Since<br>
          banks are permitted to issue loans for several times the value
          of<br>
          their reserves with the FED, such a transaction permits them
          to issue<br>
          loans for a much larger sum.<br>
          <br>
          Central banks can also change the quantity of money by raising<br>
          the discount rate which forces the lesser banks to raise their<br>
          discount rates; such a raise in interest rates tends to reduce
          the<br>
          demand for credit and thus the amount of deposits (money).
          Lowering<br>
          the discount rate permits an opposite result.<br>
          <br>
          It is noted that the control of the central bank over the
          credit<br>
          policies of local banks are permissive in one direction and
          compulsive<br>
          in the other. They can compel these local banks to curtail
          credit and<br>
          can only permit them to increase credit. This means that they
          have<br>
          control powers against inflation and not deflation - a
          reflection of<br>
          the old banking idea that inflation was bad and deflation was
          good.<br>

          The powers of governments over the quantity of money are:<br>
          <br>
          a) control over a central bank;<br>
          b) control over public taxation;<br>
          c) control over public spending;<br>
          <br>
          Since most central banks have been (technically) private<br>
          institutions, this control is frequently based on custom
          rather than<br>
          on law.<br>
          <br>
          Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community
          and<br>
          is usually a deflationary force. Government spending is
          usually an<br>
          inflationary force.<br>
          <br>
          On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially
          the<br>
          Money Power controlled by the international investment
          bankers, were<br>
          able to dominate both business and government. They could
          dominate<br>
          business because investment bankers had the ability to supply
          or<br>
          refuse to supply such capital. Thus Rothschild interests came
          to<br>
          dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan
          dominated at<br>
          least 26,000 miles of American railroads. Such bankers took
          seats on<br>
          the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had
          already done<br>
          on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and
          finance<br>
          companies. From these lesser institutions, they funneled
          capital to<br>
          enterprises which yielded control and away from those who
          resisted.<br>
          These firms were controlled through interlocking
          directorships,<br>
          holding companies, and lesser banks.<br>
          <br>
          Page 61<br>
          <br>
          As early as 1909,Walter Rathenau said, "Three hundred men, all
          of<br>
          whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe
          and<br>
          choose their successors from among themselves."<br>
          <br>
          The power of investment bankers over governments rests on the<br>
          need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well
          as<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(10 of 129)<br>
          <br>
          long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to
          commercial banks<br>
          for current capital advances, so a government has to go to
          merchant<br>
          bankers to tide over the shallow places caused by irregular
          tax<br>
          receipts. As experts in government bonds, the international
          bankers<br>
          provided advice to government officials and, on many
          occasions, placed<br>
          their own members in official posts. This was so widely
          accepted even<br>
          today, that in 1961 a Republican investment banker became
          Secretary of<br>
          the Treasury in a Democratic administration in Washington
          without<br>
          significant comment from any direction.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during
          the<br>
          age of financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not
          something<br>
          about which anyone talked about freely, but it has been
          admitted<br>
          freely enough by those on the inside, especially in England.
          In 1842,<br>
          Gladstone, chancellor of the Exchequer, declared "The hinge of
          the<br>
          whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be
          the<br>
          substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the
          Money<br>
          Power supreme and unquestioned." On Sept. 26, 1921, the
          Financial<br>
          Times wrote, "Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five
          Banks could<br>
          upset the whole fabric of government finance by refraining
          from<br>
          renewing Treasury Bills." In 1924, Sir Drummond Fraser,
          vice-president<br>
          of the Institute of Bankers, stated, "The Governor of the Bank
          of<br>
          England must be the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which
          alone<br>
          the Government can obtain borrowed money."<br>
          <br>
          Page 62<br>
          <br>
          In addition to their power over government based on government<br>
          financing and personal influence, bankers could steer
          governments in<br>
          ways they wished them to go by other pressures. Since most
          government<br>
          officials felt ignorant of finance, they sought advice from
          bankers<br>
          whom they considered experts in the field. The history of the
          last<br>
          century shows that the advice given to governments by bankers,
          like<br>
          the advice they gave to industrialists, was consistently good
          for<br>
          bankers but was often disastrous for governments, businessmen
          and the<br>
          people generally.<br>
          <br>
          Such advice could be enforced if necessary by manipulation of<br>
          exchanges, gold flows, discount rates, and even levels of
          business<br>
          activity. Thus Morgan dominated Cleveland's second
          administration by<br>
          gold withdrawals, and in 1936-13 French foreign exchange
          manipulators<br>
          paralyzed the Popular Front governments. The powers of these<br>
          international bankers reached their peak in 1919-1931 when
          Montagu<br>
          Norman and J.P. Morgan dominated not only the financial world
          but<br>
          international relations and other matters as well. On Nov. 11,
          1927,<br>
          the Wall Street Journal called Mr. Norman "the currency
          dictator of<br>
          Europe." This was admitted by Mr. Norman who said, "I hold the<br>
          hegemony of the world."<br>
          <br>
          The conflict of interests between bankers and industrialists
          has<br>
          resulted in the subordination of the bankers (after 1931) to
          the<br>
          latter by the adoption of "unorthodox financial policies" -
          that is,<br>
          financial policies not in accordance with the short-run
          interests of<br>
          the bankers.<br>

          The civil service reform began in the federal government with
          the<br>
          Pendleton Bill of 1883. As a result, the government was
          controlled<br>
          with varying degrees of completeness by the forces of
          investment<br>
          banking and heavy industry from 1884 to 1933. Popularly known
          as<br>
          "Society," or the "400," they lived a life of dazzling
          splendor.<br>

          The structure of financial control created by the tycoons of
          "Big<br>
          Banking" and "Big Business" in the period 1880-1933 was of<br>
          extraordinary complexity, one business fief being built upon
          another,<br>
          both being allied with semi-independent associates, the whole
          rearing<br>
          &nbsp;(11 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power, of
          which<br>
          one, centered in New York, was headed by J.P. Morgan and
          Company, and<br>
          the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. When
          these<br>
          two cooperated, as they generally did, they could influence
          the<br>
          economic life of the country to a large degree and could
          almost<br>
          control its political life, at least on the federal level.<br>
          <br>
          The influence of these business leaders was so great that the<br>
          Morgan and Rockefeller groups acting together, or even Morgan
          acting<br>
          alone, could have wrecked the economic system of the country
          merely by<br>
          throwing securities on the stock market for sale, and having<br>
          precipitated a stock market panic, could then have bought back
          the<br>
          securities they had sold but at a lower price. Naturally, they
          were<br>
          not so foolish as to do this, although Morgan came very close
          to it in<br>
          precipitating the "panic of 1907," but they did not hesitate
          to wreck<br>
          individual corporations, at the expense of holders of common
          stock, by<br>
          driving them to bankruptcy. In this way, Morgan wrecked the
          New York,<br>
          New Haven and Hartford railroad before 1914 and William
          Rockefeller<br>
          wrecked the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad
          before<br>
          1925.<br>

          The discovery by financial capitalists that they made money
          out<br>
          of issuing and selling securities rather than out of
          production,<br>
          distribution and consumption of goods accordingly led them to
          the<br>
          point where they discovered that the exploiting of an
          operating<br>
          company by excessive issuance of securities or the issuance of
          bonds<br>
          rather than equity securities not only was profitable to them
          but made<br>
          it possible for them to increase their profits by bankruptcy
          of the<br>
          firm, providing fees and commission of reorganization as well
          as the<br>
          opportunity to issue new securities.<br>
          <br>
          When the business interests pushed through the first
          installment<br>
          of the civil service reform in 1881, they expected to control
          both<br>
          political parties equally. Some intended to contribute to both
          and to<br>
          allow an alternation of the two parties in public office in
          order to<br>
          conceal their own influence, inhibit any exhibition of
          independence by<br>
          politicians, and allow the electorate to believe that they
          were<br>
          exercising their own free choice.<br>
          <br>
          The inability of the investment bankers to control the
          Democratic<br>
          Party Convention of 1896 was a result of the agrarian
          discontent of<br>
          the period 1868-1896. This discontent was based very largely
          on the<br>
          monetary tactics of the banking oligarchy. The bankers were
          wedded to<br>
          the gold standard and at the end of the Civil War, persuaded
          the Grant<br>
          administration to curb the postwar inflation and go back on
          the gold<br>
          standard (crash of 1873 and resumption of specie payment in
          1875).<br>
          <br>
          Page 74<br>
          <br>
          This gave the bankers a control of the supply of money which
          they<br>
          did not hesitate to use for their own purposes. The bankers'<br>
          affection for low prices was not shared by farmers, since each
          time<br>
          prices of farm products went down, the burden of farmers'
          debts became<br>
          greater. As farmers could not reduce their costs or modify
          their<br>
          production plans, the result was a systematic exploitation of
          the<br>
          agrarian sectors of the community by the financial and
          industrial<br>
          sectors. This exploitation took the form of high industrial
          prices and<br>
          discriminatory railroad rates, high interest charges, low farm
          prices<br>
          and very low level of farm services.<br>
          <br>
          Unable to resist by economic weapons, the farmers turned to<br>
          political relief. They tried to work on the state political
          level<br>
          through local legislation (so-called Granger Laws) and set up
          third party<br>
          movements (like the Greenback Party of 1878 or the Populist<br>
          Party in 1892). By 1896, the capture of the Democratic Party
          by the<br>
          forces of discontent under William Jennings Bryant who was
          determined<br>
          &nbsp;(12 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          to obtain higher prices by increasing the supply of money on a<br>
          bimetallic rather than a gold basis, presented the electorate
          with an<br>
          election on a social and economic issue for the first time in
          a<br>
          generation. Though the forces of high finance were in a state
          of near<br>
          panic, by a mighty effort involving very large-scale spending
          they<br>
          were successful in electing McKinley.<br>
          <br>
          Though the plutocracy were unable to control the Democratic
          Party<br>
          as they controlled the Republican Party, they did not cease
          their<br>
          efforts to control both and in 1904 and 1924, Morgan was able
          to sit<br>
          back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch presidential
          elections in<br>
          which the candidates of both parties were in his sphere of
          influence.<br>
          <br>
          Page 75<br>
          <br>
          The agrarian discontent, the growth of monopolies, the
          oppression<br>
          of labor, and the excesses of Wall Street financiers made the
          country<br>
          very restless between 1890-1900. All this could have been
          alleviated<br>
          merely by increasing the supply of money sufficiently to raise
          prices<br>
          somewhat, but the financiers were determined to defend the
          gold<br>
          standard no matter what happened.<br>
          <br>
          In looking for some issue to distract public discontent from<br>
          domestic issues, what better solution than a crisis in foreign<br>
          affairs? Cleveland had stumbled upon this alternative in 1895
          when he<br>
          stirred up controversy with England over Venezuela. The great<br>
          opportunity came with the Cuban revolt against Spain in 1895.
          While<br>
          the "yellow press" roused public opinion, Henry Cabot Lodge
          and<br>
          Theodore Roosevelt plotted how they could best get the United
          States<br>
          into the fracas. They got the excuse they needed when the
          American<br>
          battleship Maine was sunk by a mysterious explosion in Havana
          Harbor<br>
          in 1898. In two months, the United States declared war on
          Spain to<br>
          fight for Cuban independence. The resulting victory revealed
          the<br>
          United States as a world naval power, established it as an
          imperialist<br>
          power with possession of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the
          Philippines.<br>
          America's entrance upon the stage as a world power continued
          with<br>
          the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the intervention in the
          Boxer<br>
          uprising in 1900, the seizure of the Panama canal in 1903, the<br>
          diplomatic intervention in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, the<br>
          military occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, the military
          intervention in<br>
          Mexico in 1916.<br>

          As an example of the more idealistic impulse we might mention
          the<br>
          creation of various Carnegie foundations to work for universal
          peace.<br>
          As an example of the more practical point of view, we might
          mention<br>
          the founding of "The New Republic," a liberal weekly paper, by
          an<br>
          agent of Morgan financed with Whitney money (1914).<br>
          <br>
          The combined forces of the liberal East and the agrarian West<br>
          were able to capture the Presidency under Woodrow Wilson in
          1912.<br>
          Wilson roused a good deal of popular enthusiasm with his talk
          of "New<br>
          Freedom" and the rights of the underdog, but his program
          amounted to<br>
          little more than an amateur attempt to establish on a federal
          basis<br>
          those reforms which agrarian and labor discontent had been
          seeking on<br>
          a state basis for many years. Wilson was by no means a radical
          and<br>
          there was a good deal of unconscious hypocrisy in many of his<br>
          resounding public speeches. His political and administrative
          reforms<br>
          were a good deal more effective than his economic or social
          reforms.<br>
          The establishment of an income tax and the Federal Reserve
          System<br>
          justified the support which Progressives had given to Wilson.
          Wilson<br>
          did much to extend equality of opportunity to wider groups of
          American<br>
          people.<br>

          supporters of westernization and reform. Paul I (1796-1801)
          was<br>
          reactionary. Alexander I (1801-1825) and Alexander II
          (1855-1881) were<br>
          reformers while Nicholas I (1825-1855) and Nicholas II
          (1855-1881)<br>
          were reactionaries. By 1864, serfdom had been abolished, and a
          fairly<br>
          modern system of law, of justice, and of education had been<br>
          established; local government had been somewhat modernized; a
          fairly<br>
          good financial and fiscal system had been established; and an
          army<br>
          based on universal military service (but lacking in equipment)
          had<br>
          been created. On the other hand, the autocracy continued in
          the hands<br>
          of weak men and the freed serfs had no adequate lands.<br>

          The first Russian railroad opened in 1838 but growth was slow<br>
          until 1857. At that time, there were only 663 miles of
          railroads, but<br>
          this figure went up over tenfold by 1871, doubled again by
          1881 with<br>
          14,000 miles, reached 37,000 by 1901 and 46,000 by 1915.<br>

          In 1900, Russia had 48% of the total world production of<br>
          petroleum products. The State Bank was made a bank of issue in
          1897<br>
          and was required by law to redeem its notes in gold, thus
          placing<br>
          Russia on the international gold standard.<br>

          In 1902, a cartel created by a dozen iron and steel firms
          handled<br>
          almost three-fourths of all Russian sales. It was controlled
          by four<br>
          foreign banking groups.<br>

          Until 1910, Stolypin continued his efforts to combine
          oppression<br>
          with reform, especially agrarian reform. Rural credit banks
          were<br>
          established; various measures were taken to place larger
          amounts of<br>
          land in the hands of the peasants; restrictions of immigration
          of<br>
          peasants, especially to Siberia, were removed; participation
          in local<br>
          government was opened to lower social classes previously
          excluded;<br>
          education, especially technical education, was made more
          accessible;<br>
          and certain provisions for social insurance were enacted into
          law. He<br>
          was assassinated in the presence of the Tsar in 1911.<br>
          <br>
          The fourth duma (1912-1916) was elected by universal suffrage.<br>

          The Ottoman Empire was divided into 21 governments and
          subdivided<br>
          into seventy vilayets, each under a pasha. The supreme ruler
          in<br>
          Constantinople was not only sultan (head of the empire) but
          was also<br>
          caliph (defender of the Muslim creed).<br>

          The Great Powers showed mild approval of the Baghdad Railway<br>
          until about 1900. Then, for more than ten years, Russia,
          Britain and<br>
          France showed violent disapproval and did all they could the
          obstruct<br>
          the project. They described the Baghdad Railway as the
          emerging wedge<br>
          of German imperialist aggression seeking to weaken and destroy
          the<br>
          Ottoman Empire and the stakes of the other powers in the area.<br>

          The Germans were not only favorably inclined toward Turkey;
          their<br>
          conduct seems to have been completely fair in regard the<br>
          administration of the railway itself. At a time when the
          American and<br>
          &nbsp;(14 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          other railways were practicing wholesale discrimination
          between<br>
          customers, the Germans had the same rates and same treatment
          for all,<br>
          including Germans and non-Germans. They worked to make the
          railroad<br>
          efficient and profitable although their income from it was
          guaranteed<br>
          by the Turkish government. In consequence, the Turkish
          payments to the<br>
          railroad steadily declined, and the government was able to
          share in<br>
          its profits to the extent of almost three million francs in
          1914.<br>
          Moreover, the Germans did not seek to monopolize control of
          the<br>
          railroad, offering to share equally with France and England
          and<br>
          eventually with the other Powers. France accepted this offer
          in 1899,<br>
          but Britain continued to refuse and placed every obstacle in
          the path<br>
          of the project.<br>
          <br>
          When the Ottoman government sought to raise their customs
          duties<br>
          from 11% to 14% in order to continue construction, Britain
          prevented<br>
          this. In order to carry on the project, the Germans sold their<br>
          railroad interests in the Balkans and gave the Ottoman
          building<br>
          subsidy of $275,000 a kilometer. In striking contrast, the
          Russians<br>
          demanded arrears of 57 million francs under the Treaty of
          1878. The<br>
          French, in spite of investments in Turkey, refused to allow
          Baghdad<br>
          Railway securities to be handled on the Paris Stock Exchange.<br>
          <br>
          Page 123<br>
          <br>
          In 1903, Britain made an agreement for a joint German, French,<br>
          and British control of the railroad. Within three weeks this
          agreement<br>
          was repudiated because of newspaper protests against it. When
          the<br>
          Turkish government tried to borrow, it was summarily rebuffed
          in Paris<br>
          and London, but obtained the sum unhesitatingly in Berlin. The
          growth<br>
          of German prestige and the decline in favor of the Western
          Powers at<br>
          the sultan's court is not surprising and goes far to explain
          the<br>
          Turkish intervention on the side of the Central powers in the
          war of<br>
          1914-1919.<br>
          <br>
          Britain withdrew her opposition to the Baghdad Railway in
          return<br>
          for promises that:<br>
          <br>
          1) it would not be extended to the Persian Gulf;<br>
          2) British capitalists would be given a monopoly on the
          navigation of<br>
          the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and exclusive control over
          their<br>
          irrigation projects;<br>
          3) 2 British subjects would be given seats on the Board of
          directors;<br>
          4) Britain would have exclusive control over commercial
          activities in<br>
          Kuwait, the only good port on the upper Persian Gulf;<br>
          5) a monopoly over the oil resources given to a new
          corporation: Royal<br>
          Dutch Shell Company in which British held half interest, the
          Germans<br>
          and French a quarter interest each;<br>

          In England, the landed class obtained control of the bar and
          the<br>
          bench and were, thus, in a position to judge all disputes
          about real<br>
          property in their favor. Control of the courts and of the
          Parliament<br>
          made it possible for this ruling group to override the rights
          of<br>
          peasants in land, to eject them from the land, to enclose the
          open<br>
          fields of the medieval system, to deprive the cultivators of
          their<br>
          manorial rights and thus reduce them to the condition of
          landless<br>
          rural laborers or tenants.<br>

          Until 1870, there was no professorships of Fine Arts at
          Oxford,<br>
          but in that year, thanks to a bequest,John Ruskin was named to
          such a<br>
          chair. He hit Oxford like an earthquake, not so much because
          he talked<br>
          about fine arts but because he talked about the empire and
          England's<br>
          downtrodden masses as moral issues. Until the end of the
          nineteenth<br>
          century, the poverty-stricken masses in the cities lived in
          want,<br>
          ignorance and crime much like described by Charles Dickens.
          Ruskin<br>
          spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the
          privileged ruling<br>
          &nbsp;(15 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          class. He told them that they were the possessors of a
          magnificent<br>
          tradition of education, beauty, rule of law, freedom, decency,
          and<br>
          self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved and
          did not<br>
          deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower
          classes<br>
          and to the non-English masses throughout the world. If not
          extended to<br>
          these classes, the minority upper-class would be submerged and
          the<br>
          tradition lost.<br>
          <br>
          Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural
          lecture<br>
          was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes.
          Rhodes<br>
          feverishly exploited the diamond and gold fields of South
          Africa, rose<br>
          to be prime minister of Cape Colony, contributed money to
          political<br>
          parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and
          South<br>
          Africa.<br>
          <br>
          With financial support from Lord Rothschild, he was able to<br>
          monopolize the diamond mines as De Beers Mines and Gold
          Fields. In the<br>
          mid 1890s, Rhodes had a personal income of a least a million
          pounds<br>
          (then five million dollars) a year which was spent so freely
          for his<br>
          mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on his
          account.<br>
          These purposes centered on his desire to federate the
          English-speaking<br>
          peoples and to bring all the habitable portions of the world
          under<br>
          their control.<br>
          <br>
          Page 131<br>

          Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group
          of<br>
          intimate friends who devoted the rest of their lives to
          carrying out<br>
          his ideas. They were remarkably successful in these aims.<br>
          In 1891, Rhodes organized a secret society with members in a<br>
          "Circle of Initiates" and an outer circle known as the
          "Association of<br>
          Helpers" later organized as the Round Table organization.<br>
          <br>
          Page 132<br>
          <br>
          In 1909-1913, they organized semi-secret groups know as Round<br>
          Table Groups in the chief British dependencies and the United
          States.<br>
          In 1919, they founded the Royal Institute of International
          Affairs.<br>
          Similar Institutes of International Affairs were established
          in the<br>
          chief British dominions and the United States where it is
          known as the<br>
          Council on Foreign Relations. After 1925, the Institute of
          Pacific<br>
          Relations was set up in twelve Pacific area countries.<br>
          <br>
          Page 133<br>
          <br>
          They were constantly harping on the lessons to be learned from<br>
          the failure of the American Revolution and the success of the
          Canadian<br>
          federation of 1867 and hoped to federate the various parts of
          the<br>
          empire and then confederate the whole with the United Kingdom<br>
          <br>
          EGYPT AND THE SUDAN TO 1922<br>
          <br>
          Disraeli's purchase, with Rothschild money, of 176,602 shares
          of<br>
          Suez Canal stock for #3,680,000 from the Khedive of Egypt in
          1875 was<br>
          motivated by concern for communications with India just as the<br>
          acquisition of the Cape of Good Hope in 1814 had resulted from
          the<br>
          same concern.<br>

          As a result of complex and secret negotiations in which Lord<br>
          Rosebery was the chief figure, Britain kept Uganda, Rhodes was
          made a<br>
          privy councilor, Rosebery replaced his father-in-law, Lord
          Rothschild,<br>
          in Rhodes secret group and was made a trustee under Rhodes'
          next and<br>

          By 1895, the Transvaal Republic presented an acute problem.
          All<br>
          political control was in the hands of a rural, backward, Bible
          reading,<br>
          racist minority of Boers while all economic wealth was in the<br>
          hands of a violent, aggressive majority of foreigners,
          (Utlanders)<br>
          most of whom lived in Johannesburg. The Utlanders, who were
          twice as<br>
          numerous and owned two thirds of the land and nine-tenths of
          the<br>
          &nbsp;(16 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          wealth of the country, were prevented from participating in
          political<br>
          life or from becoming citizens (except after 14 years
          residence) and<br>
          were irritated by President Paul Kruger's intriguing to obtain
          some<br>
          kind of German intervention and protection.<br>
          At this point, Rhodes made his plans to overthrow Kruger's<br>
          government by an uprising in Johannesburg, financed by himself
          and led<br>
          by his brother Frank, followed by an invasion led by Frank
          Jameson<br>
          from Rhodesia. Flora Shaw used The Times to prepare public
          opinion in<br>
          England while others negotiated for the official support
          necessary.<br>
          When the revolt fizzled, Jameson raided anyway and was easily<br>
          captured by the Boers. The public officials involved denounced
          the<br>
          plot, loudly proclaimed their surprise at the event, and were
          able to<br>
          whitewash most of the participants in the subsequent
          parliamentary<br>
          inquiry. A telegram from the German Kaiser to Kruger
          congratulating<br>
          him on his success "in preserving the independence of his
          country,"<br>
          was built up by The Times into an example of brazen German<br>
          interference in British affairs, and almost eclipsed Jameson's<br>
          aggression.<br>
          <br>
          Rhodes was stopped only temporarily. For almost two years, he
          and<br>
          his friends stayed quiet waiting for the storm to blow over.
          Then they<br>
          began to act again. Propaganda, most of it true about the
          plight of<br>
          the Utlanders flooded England from Flora Shaw. Milner was made
          British<br>
          High Commissioner to South Africa; his friend Brett worked his
          way<br>
          into the confidence of the monarchy to become its chief
          political<br>
          advisor. Milner made provocative British troop movements on
          the Boer<br>
          frontiers in spite of the vigorous protests of his commanding
          general<br>
          in South Africa, who had to be removed; and finally, war was<br>
          precipitated when Smuts drew up an ultimatum insisting that
          the<br>
          British troop movements cease and when this was rejected by
          Milner.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The Boer War (1899-1902) was one of the most important events
          in<br>
          British imperial history. The ability of 40,000 Boer farmers
          to hold<br>
          off ten times as many British for three years, inflicting a
          series of<br>
          defeats on them over that period, destroyed faith in British
          power.<br>
          Although the Boer republics were defeated and annexed in 1902,<br>
          Britain's confidence was so shaken that it made a treaty with
          Japan<br>
          providing that if either became engaged in war with two
          enemies in the<br>
          Far East, the other would come to the rescue. This treaty
          allowed<br>
          Japan to attack Russia in 1904.<br>

          Milner's group, known as "Milner's Kindergarten" reorganized
          the<br>
          government. By 1914, the Smuts government passed a law
          excluding<br>
          natives from most semi-skilled or skilled work or any
          high-paying<br>
          positions.<br>

          By the Land Act of 1913, 7% was reserved for purchases by
          natives<br>
          and the other 93% by whites. The wages of natives were about
          one tenth<br>
          of those of whites.<br>

          <br>
          These natives lived on inadequate and eroded reserves or in<br>
          horrible urban slums and were drastically restricted in
          movements,<br>
          residence, or economic opportunities and had almost no
          political or<br>
          even civil rights. By 1950 in Johannesburg, 90,000 Africans
          were<br>
          crowded into 600 acres of shacks with no sanitation with
          almost no<br>
          running water and denied all opportunity except for animal
          survival<br>
          and reproduction.<br>

          In 1908, the Milner Round Table group worked a scheme to
          reserve<br>
          the tropical portions of Africa north of the Zambezi river for
          natives<br>
          under such attractive conditions that the blacks south of that
          river<br>
          &nbsp;(17 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          would be enticed to migrate northward. Its policy would be to
          found a<br>
          Negro dominion in which Blacks could own land, enter
          professions, and<br>
          stand on a footing of equality with Whites. Although this
          project has<br>
          not been achieved, it provides the key to Britain's native
          policies<br>
          from 1917 onward.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          In 1903, when Milner took over the Boer states, he tried to<br>
          follow the policy that native could vote. This was blocked by
          the<br>
          Kindergarten because they considered reconciliation with the
          Boers to<br>
          be more urgent.<br>
          <br>
          In South Africa, the three native protectorates of Swaziland,<br>
          Bechuanaland, and Basutoland were retained by the imperial
          authorities<br>
          as areas where native rights were paramount and where tribal
          forms of<br>
          living could be maintained at least partially.<br>

          Back in London, they founded the Round Table and met in
          conclaves<br>
          presided over by Milner to decide the fate of the empire.
          Curtis and<br>
          others were sent around the world to organize Round Table
          groups in<br>
          the chief British dependencies to give them, including India
          and<br>
          Ireland, their complete independence.<br>
          <br>
          Page 146<br>
          <br>
          The creation of the Round Table groups was so secretive that,<br>
          even today, many close students of the subject are not aware
          of its<br>
          significance.<br>
          <br>
          Page 147<br>
          <br>
          Curtis said, "The task of preparing for freedom the races
          which<br>
          cannot as yet govern themselves is the supreme duty of those
          who can.<br>
          Personally, I regard this challenge to the long unquestioned
          claim of<br>
          the white man to dominate the world as inevitable and
          wholesome,<br>
          especially to ourselves. Our whole race has outgrown the
          merely<br>
          national state and will pass either to a Commonwealth of
          Nations or<br>
          else to an empire of slaves. And the issue of these agonies
          rests with<br>
          us."<br>

          Publicity for their views on civilizing the natives and
          training<br>
          them for eventual self-government received wide dissemination.<br>

          By 1950 Kenya had discontented and detribalized blacks working<br>
          for low wages on lands owned by whites. It had about two
          million<br>
          blacks and only 3,400 whites in 1910. Forty years later, it
          had about<br>
          4 million blacks and only 30,000 whites. The healthful
          highlands were<br>
          reserved for white ownership as early as 1908. The native
          reserves had<br>
          five times as much land although they had 150 times as many
          people.<br>
          The whites tried to increase the pressure on natives to work
          on<br>
          white farms rather than to seek to make a living on their own
          lands<br>
          within the reserves, by forcing them to pay taxes in cash, by<br>
          curtailing the size or quality of the reserves, by restricting<br>
          improvements in native agricultural techniques and by personal
          and<br>
          political pressure and compulsion.<br>
          <br>
          The real crux of the controversy before the Mau Mau uprising
          of<br>
          1948-1955 was the problem of self-government; Pointing to
          South<br>
          Africa, the settlers in Kenya demanded self-rule which would
          allow<br>
          them to enforce restrictions on non-whites.<br>
          <br>
          Page 151<br>
          <br>
          From this controversy came a compromise which gave Kenya a<br>
          Legislative Council containing representatives of the imperial<br>
          government, the white settlers, the Indians, the Arabs, and a
          white<br>
          missionary to represent the blacks. Most were nominated rather
          than<br>
          elected but by 1949, only the official and Negro members were<br>
          &nbsp;(18 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          nominated.<br>

          As a result of the 1923 continued encroachment of white
          settlers<br>
          on native preserves, the 1930 Native Land Trust Ordinance
          guaranteed<br>
          native reserves but these reserves remained inadequate.<br>

          Efforts to extend the use of native courts, councils and to
          train<br>
          natives for an administrative service were met with growing
          suspicion<br>
          based on the conviction that the whites were hypocrites who
          taught a<br>
          religion that they did not obey, were traitors to Christ's
          teachings,<br>
          and were using these to control the natives and to betray
          their<br>
          interests under cover of religious ideas which the whites
          themselves<br>
          did not observe in practice.<br>

          INDIA TO 1926<br>
          <br>
          Although the East India Company was a commercial firm, it had
          to<br>
          intervene again and again to restore order, replacing one
          nominal<br>
          ruler by another and even taking over the government of those
          areas<br>
          where it was more immediately concerned and to divert to their
          own<br>
          pockets some of the fabulous wealth they saw flowing by. Areas
          under<br>
          rule expanded steadily until by 1858 they covered three-fifths
          of the<br>
          country.<br>
          <br>
          Page 154<br>
          <br>
          In 1857-1858, a sudden, violent insurrection of native forces,<br>
          known as the Great Mutiny, resulted in the end of the Mogul
          empire and<br>
          of the East India Company, the British government taking over
          their<br>
          political activities.<br>
          <br>
          Page 157<br>
          <br>
          Numerous legislative enactments sought to improve the
          conditions<br>
          but were counterbalanced... by the growing burden of peasant
          debt at<br>
          onerous terms and at high interest rates. Although slavery was<br>
          abolished in 1843, many of the poor were reduced to peonage by<br>
          contracting debts at unfair terms and binding themselves and
          their<br>
          heirs to work for their creditors until the debt was paid.
          Such a debt<br>
          could never be paid, in many cases, because the rate at which
          it was<br>
          reduced was left to the creditor and could rarely be
          questioned by the<br>
          illiterate debtor.<br>

          In spite of India's poverty, there was a considerable volume
          of<br>
          savings arising chiefly from the inequitable distribution of
          income to<br>
          the landlord class and to the moneylenders (if these two
          groups can be<br>
          separated in this way).<br>

          <br>
          Hinduism was influenced by Christianity and Islam so that the<br>
          revived Hinduism was really a synthesis of these three
          religions.<br>
          Played down was the old and basic Hindu idea of Karma where
          each would<br>
          reappeared again and again in a different physical form and in
          a<br>
          different social status, each difference being a reward or
          punishment<br>
          for the soul's conduct in at it's previous appearance. There
          was no<br>
          real hope of escape from this cycle, except by a gradual
          improvement<br>
          through a long series of successive appearances to the
          ultimate goal<br>
          of complete obliteration of personality (Nirvana) by ultimate
          mergence<br>
          in the soul of the universe (Brahma). This release (moksha)
          from the<br>
          endless cycle of existence could be achieved only by the
          suppression<br>
          of all desire, of all individuality and of all will to live.<br>

          The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the seventeenth century<br>
          had transferred much Irish land, as plunder of war, to
          absentee<br>
          English landlords. In consequence, high rents, insecure
          tenure, lack<br>

          <br>
          The destruction of traditional Chinese culture under the
          impact<br>
          of Western Civilization was considerably later than the
          similar<br>
          destruction of Indian culture by Europeans<br>
          <br>
          The upper-most group derived its income as tribute and taxes
          from<br>
          its possession of military and political power the middle
          group<br>
          derived its incomes from sources such as interest on loans,
          rents from<br>
          lands and the profits from commercial enterprises. Although
          the<br>
          peasants were clearly an exploited group, this exploitation
          was<br>
          impersonal and traditional and thus more easily borne.<br>
          <br>
          Page 179<br>
          <br>
          Only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century did<br>
          peasants in China come to regard their positions as so
          hopeless that<br>
          violence became preferable to diligence or conformity. This
          change<br>
          arose from the fact that the impact of Western culture on
          China did,<br>
          in fact, make a peasant's position economically hopeless.<br>
          <br>
          Page 180<br>
          <br>
          Chinese society was too weak to defend itself against the
          West.<br>
          When it tried to do so, as in the Opium Wars of 1840-1861 or
          in the<br>
          Boxer uprising of 1900, such Chinese resistance to European<br>
          penetration was crushed by armaments of the Western Powers and
          all<br>
          kinds of concessions to these Powers were imposed on China.<br>
          Until 1841, Canton was the only port allowed for foreign
          imports<br>
          and opium was illegal. As a consequence of Chinese destruction
          of<br>
          illegal Indian opium and the commercial exactions of Cantonese<br>
          authorities, Britain imposed on China the treaties of Nanking
          (1842)<br>
          and of Tientsin (1858). These forced China to cede Hong Kong
          to<br>
          Britain and to open sixteen ports to foreign trade, to impose
          a<br>
          uniform import tariff of no more than 5%, to pay an indemnity
          of about<br>
          $100 million, to permit foreign legations in Peking, to allow
          a<br>
          British official to act as head of the Chinese customs
          service, and to<br>
          legalize the import of opium. China lost Burma to Britain,
          Indochina<br>
          to France. Also Formosa and the Pescadores to Japan, Macao to<br>
          Portugal, Kiaochow to Germany, Liaotung (including Port
          Arthur) to<br>
          Russia, France took Kwangchowan and Britain took Kowloon and<br>
          Weihaiwei. Various Powers imposed on China a system of<br>
          extraterritorial courts under which foreigners in judicial
          cases could<br>
          not be tried in Chinese courts or under Chinese law.<br>

          Four chief reasons have been given for the intervention of the<br>
          United States in World War I.<br>
          <br>
          1) to secure "freedom of the seas" from German submarine
          attacks;<br>
          2)British propaganda;<br>
          3) a conspiracy by international bankers and munitions
          manufacturers<br>
          either to protect their loans to the Entente Powers or their
          wartime<br>
          profits from sales to these Powers;<br>
          4) Balance of Power principles to prevent Great Britain from
          being<br>
          defeated by Germany<br>
          <br>
          Page 250<br>
          <br>
          The fact that German submarines were acting in retaliation for<br>
          the illegal British blockades of the continent of Europe and
          British<br>
          violations of international law and neutral rights on the high
          seas.<br>
          Britain was close to defeat in April 1917 and on that basis
          the<br>
          United States entered the war. The unconscious assumption by
          American<br>
          leaders that an Entente victory was inevitable was at the
          bottom of<br>
          their failure to enforce the same rules of neutrality and<br>
          international law against Britain as against Germany. They
          constantly<br>
          assumed that British violations of these rules could be
          compensated<br>
          with monetary damages while German violations of these rules<br>
          must be resisted by force if necessary. Since they could not
          admit<br>
          this unconscious assumption or publicly defend the legitimate
          basis of<br>
          international power politics on which it rested, they finally
          went to<br>
          war on an excuse which was legally weak, "the assertion of a
          right to<br>
          protect belligerent ships on which Americans saw fit to travel
          and the<br>
          treatment of armed belligerent merchantmen as peaceful
          vessels. Both<br>
          assumptions were contrary to reason and to settled law and no
          other<br>
          professed neutral advanced them."<br>
          <br>
          The Germans at first tried to use the established rules of<br>
          international law regarding destruction of merchant vessels.
          This<br>
          proved so dangerous because the British instructions to
          merchant ships<br>
          to attack submarines. American protests reached a peak when
          the<br>
          Lusitania was sunk in 1915. The Lusitania was a British
          merchant<br>
          vessel constructed as an auxiliary cruiser carrying a cargo of
          2,400<br>
          cases of rifle cartridges and 1250 cases of shrapnel with
          orders to<br>
          attack German submarines whenever possible. The incompetence
          of the<br>
          acting captain contributed to the heavy loss of life as did
          also a<br>
          mysterious second explosion after the German torpedo struck.
          The<br>
          captain was on course he had orders to avoid; he was running
          at<br>
          reduced speed, he had an inexperienced crew; the portholes had
          been<br>
          left open; the lifeboats had not been swung out; and no
          lifeboat<br>
          drills had been held.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The propaganda agencies of the Entente Powers made full use of<br>
          the occasion. The Times of London announced that 80% were
          citizens of<br>
          the US (actually 15.6%); the British manufactured and
          distributed a<br>
          medal which they pretended had been awarded to the submarine
          crew by<br>
          the German government; a French paper published a picture of
          the<br>
          crowds in Berlin at the outbreak of war in 1914 as a picture
          of<br>
          Germans "rejoicing" at the news of the sinking of the
          Lusitania.<br>
          The US protested violently against the submarine warfare while<br>
          brushing aside German arguments based on the British blockade.
          It was<br>
          so irreconcilable in these protests that Germany sent Wilson a
          note<br>
          which promised that "in the future merchant vessels within and
          without<br>
          the war zone shall not be sunk without warning and without<br>
          safeguarding human lives unless these ships try to escape or
          offer<br>
          resistance. In return, the German government hoped that the US
          would<br>
          put pressure on Britain to follow the established rules of<br>
          international law in regard to blockade and freedom of the
          sea. Wilson<br>
          refused to do so. It became clear to the Germans that they
          would be<br>
          starved into defeat unless they could defeat Britain first by<br>
          &nbsp;(21 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          unrestricted submarine warfare. Since they were aware this
          would<br>
          probably bring the US into the war against them, they made
          another<br>
          effort to negotiate peace before resorting to it. It was
          rejected by<br>
          the Entente Powers on Dec. 27 and unrestricted submarine
          attacks were<br>
          resumed. Wilson broke off diplomatic relations and the
          Congress<br>
          declared war on April 3, 1917.<br>
          <br>
          Page 252<br>
          <br>
          Britain was unwilling to accept any peace which would leave<br>
          Germany supreme on the continent or in a position to resume
          the<br>
          commercial, naval, and colonial rivalry which had existed
          before 1914.<br>

          The Vatican, working through Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius<br>
          XII) sought a negotiated peace.<br>
          <br>
          On Oct 5, a German note to Wilson asked for an armistice based
          on<br>
          the basis of the Fourteen Points which promised the end of
          secret<br>
          diplomacy, freedom of the seas; freedom of commerce;
          disarmament; a<br>
          fair settlement of colonial claims, with the interests of the
          native<br>
          peoples receiving equal weight with the titles of the
          Imperialist<br>
          Powers; the evacuation of Russia, the evacuation and
          restoration<br>
          of Belgium, the evacuation of France and the restoration of
          her<br>
          Alsace-Lorraine as in 1870.<br>

          The Entente Supreme War Council refused to accept the Fourteen<br>
          Points as the basis for peace until Colonel House threatened
          that the<br>
          US would make a separate peace with Germany.<br>
          <br>
          Page 255<br>
          <br>
          Wilson had clearly promised that the peace treaty would be<br>
          negotiated and based on the Fourteen Points but the Treaty of<br>
          Versailles was imposed without negotiation and the Fourteen
          Points<br>
          fared very poorly in its provisions. The subsequent claim of
          the<br>
          German militarists that the German Army was never defeated but
          was<br>
          "stabbed in the back" by the home front through a combination
          of<br>
          international Catholics, international Jews, and international<br>
          Socialists have no merit whatever.<br>
          <br>
          On all fronts, almost 13 million men in the various armed
          forces<br>
          died and the war destroyed over $400 billion in property at a
          time<br>
          when the value of every object in France and Belgium was not
          worth<br>
          over $75 billion.<br>
          <br>
          Page 256<br>
          <br>
          In July 1914, the military men were confident that a decision<br>
          would be reached in six months. This belief was supported by
          the<br>
          financial experts who, while greatly underestimating the cost
          of<br>
          fighting, were confident financial resources would be
          exhausted in six<br>
          months. By financial resources, they meant "gold reserves."
          These were<br>
          clearly limited; all the Great Powers were on the gold
          standard.<br>
          However each country suspended the gold standard at the
          outbreak of<br>
          war. This removed the automatic limitation on the supply of
          paper<br>
          money. The each country proceeded to pay for the war by
          borrowing from<br>
          the banks. The banks created the money which they lent my
          merely<br>
          giving the government a deposit of any size against which the<br>
          government could draw checks. The banks were no longer limited
          in the<br>
          amount of credit they could create because they no longer had
          to pay<br>
          out gold for checks on demand. This the creation of money in
          the form<br>
          of credit by the banks was limited only by the demands of its<br>
          borrowers. Naturally, as governments borrowed to pay for their
          needs,<br>
          private businesses borrowed to be able to fill the<br>
          government's orders. The percentage of outstanding bank notes
          covered<br>
          by gold reserves steadily fell and the percentage of bank
          credit<br>
          covered by either gold or bank notes fell even further.<br>
          Naturally, when the supply of money was increased in this
          fashion<br>
          &nbsp;(22 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          faster than the supply of goods, prices rose because a larger
          supply<br>
          of money was competing for a smaller supply of goods. People
          received<br>
          money for making capital goods, consumer goods and munitions
          but they<br>
          could spend their money only to buy consumer goods. The
          problem of<br>
          public debt became steadily worse because governments were
          financing<br>
          such a large part of their activities by bank credit. Public
          debts<br>
          rose by 1000 percent.<br>
          <br>
          Page 259<br>
          <br>
          Governments began to regulate imports and exports to ensure
          that<br>
          necessary materials stayed in the country and did not go to
          enemy<br>
          states. This led to the British blockade of Europe.<br>
          <br>
          Page 251<br>
          <br>
          The results of the blockade were devastating. Continued for<br>
          nine months after the armistice, it caused the deaths of
          800,000<br>
          persons, reparations took 108,000 horses, 205,000 cattle,
          426,000<br>
          sheep and 240,000 fowl.<br>

          Countries engaged in a variety of activities designed to<br>
          regulate the flow of information which involved censorship,
          propaganda<br>
          and curtailment of civil liberties.<br>

          The War Propaganda Bureau was able to control almost all<br>
          information going to the American press.<br>
          <br>
          The Censorship and Propaganda bureaus worked together. The
          former<br>
          concealed all stories of Entente violations of the laws of war
          or of<br>
          the rules of humanity while the Propaganda Bureau widely
          publicized<br>
          the violations and crudities of the Central Powers. The German<br>
          violation of Belgian neutrality was constantly bewailed,while
          nothing<br>
          was said of the Entente violation of Greek neutrality. A great
          deal<br>
          was made of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia while the Russian<br>
          mobilization which had precipitated the war was hardly
          mentioned. In<br>
          the Central Powers a great deal was made of the Entente
          encirclement<br>
          while nothing was said of the Kaiser's demands for "a place in
          the<br>
          sun" of the High Command's refusal to renounce annexation of
          any part<br>
          of Belgium.<br>
          <br>
          Manufacture of outright lies by propaganda agencies was<br>
          infrequent and the desired picture of the enemy was built up
          by a<br>
          process of selection and distortion of evidence until, by
          1918,many in<br>
          the West regarded the Germans as bloodthirsty and sadistic
          militarists<br>
          while the Germans regarded the Russians as "subhuman
          monsters." A<br>
          great deal was made, especially by the British, of "atrocity"<br>
          propaganda; stories of German mutilation of bodies, violation
          of<br>
          women, cutting off a children's hands, desecration of
          churches, and<br>
          crucifixions of Belgians were widely believed in the West by
          1916. In<br>
          1917, Henry Carter is created a story that the Germans were
          cooking<br>
          human bodies to extract glycerin and produced pictures to
          prove it.<br>
          Again, photographs of mutilated bodies in a Russian
          anti-Semitic<br>
          outrage in 1905 were circulated as pictures of Belgians in
          1915. There<br>
          were several reasons for the use of such atrocity stories:<br>
          <br>
          a) to build up the fighting spirit of the mass army;<br>
          b) to stiffen civilian morale;<br>
          c) to encourage enlistments;<br>
          d) to increase subscriptions for war bonds;<br>
          e) to justify one's own breaches of international law;<br>
          f) to destroy the chances of negotiating peace or to justify a
          severe<br>
          final peace;<br>
          g) to win the support of the neutrals.<br>
          <br>
          The relative innocence and credulity of the average person who<br>
          was not yet immunized to propaganda assaults through mediums
          of mass<br>
          communication in 1914 made the use of such stories relatively<br>
          effective. But the discovery in the period after 1919 that
          they had<br>
          &nbsp;(23 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          been hoaxed gave rise to a skepticism toward all government<br>
          communications which was especially noticeable in the Second
          World<br>
          War.<br>

          THE PEACE SETTLEMENTS 1919-1923<br>
          <br>
          Page 267<br>
          <br>
          The criticisms of the peace settlements was as ardent from the<br>
          victors as from the vanquished aimed at the terms which were
          neither<br>
          unfair nor ruthless. The causes of the discontent rested on
          the<br>
          procedures which were used rather than the terms themselves.
          Above<br>
          all, there was discontent at the contrast between the
          procedures which<br>
          were used and the procedures which pretended to be used, as
          well as<br>
          between the high-minded principles which were supposed to be
          applied<br>
          and those which really were applied.<br>
          <br>
          Page 268<br>
          <br>
          When it became clear that they were to be imposed rather than<br>
          negotiated, that the Fourteen Points had been lost in the
          confusion,<br>
          that the terms had been reached by a process of secret
          negotiations<br>
          from which the smaller nations had been excluded, there was a<br>
          revulsion against the treaties. By 1929, most of the Western
          World had<br>
          feelings of guilt and shame whenever they thought of the
          Versailles<br>
          Treaty. In England, the same groups, often the same people,
          who had<br>
          made the wartime propaganda and the peace settlements were
          loudest in<br>
          their complaint that the latter had fallen far below the
          ideals of the<br>
          former while all the while their real aims were to use power
          politics<br>
          to the benefit of Britain.<br>
          <br>
          The peace settlements were made by an organization which was<br>
          chaotic and by a procedure which was fraudulent. None of this
          was<br>
          deliberate. It arose rather from weakness and ignorance, from
          a<br>
          failure to decide on what principles it would be based.<br>
          <br>
          Page 269<br>
          <br>
          ]Since the Germans had been promised the right to negotiate,
          it<br>
          became clear that the terms could not first be made the
          subject of<br>
          public compromise. Unfortunately, by the time the victorious
          Great<br>
          Powers realized all this and decided to make the terms by
          secret<br>
          negotiations among themselves, invitations had already been
          sent to<br>
          all the victorious powers to come to the conference. As a
          solution to<br>
          this embarrassing situation, the peace treaty was made on two
          levels.<br>
          On one level, in the full glare of publicity, the Inter-Allied<br>
          Conference became the Plenary Peace<br>
          <br>
          Conference and with the considerable fanfare, did nothing. ON<br>
          the other level, the Great Powers worked out their peace terms
          in<br>
          secret and when they were ready, imposed them simultaneously
          on the<br>
          conference and on the Germans. This had not been intended. It
          was not<br>
          clear to anyone just what was being done.<br>
          <br>
          Page 271<br>
          <br>
          At all these meetings, as at the Peace Conference itself, the<br>
          political leaders were assisted by groups of experts and
          interested<br>
          persons. Many of the experts were members associates of the<br>
          international banking fraternity. In every case but one, where
          a<br>
          committee of experts submitted a unanimous report, the Supreme
          Council<br>
          accepted its recommendation. The one case where a report was
          not<br>
          accepted was concerned with the Polish corridor, the same
          issue which<br>
          led to the Second World War where the experts were much
          harsher on<br>
          Germany than the final decision of the politicians.<br>
          <br>
          Page 272<br>
          <br>
          The German delegation offered to accept the disarmament<br>
          sections and reparations if the Allies would withdraw any
          statement<br>
          &nbsp;(24 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          that Germany had, alone, caused the war and would re-admit
          Germany to<br>
          the world's markets.<br>
          <br>
          Page 273<br>
          <br>
          The Allies answer accused the Germans of sole guilt in causing<br>
          the war and of inhuman practices during it. The Germans voted
          to sign<br>
          if the articles on war guilt and war criminals could be struck
          from<br>
          the treaty.. When the Allies refused these concessions, the
          Catholic<br>
          Center Party voted 64-14 not to sign. The High Command of the
          German<br>
          army ordered the Cabinet to sign. The Treaty of Versailles was
          signed<br>
          by all the delegations except the Chinese in protest against
          the<br>
          disposition of the prewar German concessions in Shantung.<br>

          No progress was possible in Hungary without some solution of
          the<br>
          agrarian question and the peasant discontent arising from<br>
          monopolization of the land.<br>
          <br>
          The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (acting on behalf of<br>
          France's greatest industrialist, Eugene Schneider) made a deal
          with<br>
          the Hungarians that if they would sign the Treaty of Trianon
          and give<br>
          Schneider control of the Hungarian state railways, the port of<br>
          Budapest and the Hungarian General Credit Bank, France would<br>
          eventually make Hungary one of the mainstays of its
          anti-German bloc<br>
          in Eastern Europe and, at the proper time, obtain a drastic
          revision<br>
          of the Treaty of Trianon. Paleologue received his reward from<br>
          Schneider. He was made director of Schneider's personal
          holding<br>
          company.<br>
          <br>
          The Treaty of Sevres with Turkey was never signed because of
          the<br>
          scandal caused by the Bolshevik publication of the secret
          treaties<br>
          regarding the Ottoman Empire, since these treaties contrasted
          so<br>
          sharply with the expressed war aims of the Allies.<br>
          <br>
          The British felt that richer prospects were to be obtained
          from<br>
          the Turkish sultan. In particular, the French were prepared to
          support<br>
          the claims of Standard Oil to such concessions while the
          British were<br>
          prepared to support Royal Dutch Shell.<br>

          The chief territorial disputes arose over the Polish corridor.<br>
          France's Foch wanted to give all of East Prussia to Poland.
          Instead,<br>
          the experts gave Poland access to the sea by severing East
          Prussia<br>
          from the rest of Germany by creating a Polish corridor in the
          valley<br>
          of the Vistula. However, the city of Danzig was clearly a
          German city<br>
          and Lloyd George refused to give it to Poland. Instead, it was
          a made<br>
          a free city under the protection of the League of Nations.<br>
          <br>
          Page 279<br>
          <br>
          The most violent controversies arose in regard to the
          boundaries<br>
          of Poland. Of these, only that with Germany was set by the
          Treaty of<br>
          Versailles. The Poles refused to accept their other frontiers
          and by<br>
          1920 were at war with Lithuania over Vilna, with Russia over
          the<br>
          eastern border, with the Ukrainians over Galaicia, and with<br>
          Czechoslovakia over Teschen.<br>
          <br>
          Page 280<br>
          <br>
          These territorial disputes are of importance because they<br>
          continued to lacerate relationships between neighboring states
          until<br>
          well into the period of World War II. There were 1,000,000
          Germans<br>
          living in Poland, 550,000 in Hungary, 3,100,000 in
          Czechoslovakia,<br>
          about 700,000 in Romania, 500,000 in Yugoslavia and 250,000 in
          Italy.<br>
          To protect these minorities, the Allied Powers forced the new
          states<br>
          to sign treaties grating a certain minimum political rights
          guaranteed<br>
          by the League of Nations with no power to enforce observation
          of them.<br>

          The French were torn between a desire to obtain as large a<br>
          fraction as possible of Germany's payments and a desire to
          pile on<br>
          Germany such a crushing burden of indebtedness that Germany
          would be<br>
          &nbsp;(25 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          ruined beyond the point where it could threaten French
          security again.<br>
          A compromise originally suggested by John Foster Dulles was<br>
          adopted by which Germany was forced to admit an unlimited,<br>
          theoretical obligation to pay but was actually bound to pay
          for only<br>
          a limited list of ten categories of obligations with pensions
          being<br>
          larger than the preceding nine categories together. All
          reparations<br>
          were wiped out in the financial debacle of 1931-1932.<br>
          <br>

          Britain had obtained all her chief ambitions. The German navy
          was<br>
          at the bottom of Scapa Flow scuttled by the the Germans
          themselves;<br>
          the German merchant fleet was scattered, captured, destroyed;
          the<br>
          German colonial rivalry was ended and its areas occupied; the
          German<br>
          commercial rivalry was crippled by the loss of its patents and<br>
          industrial techniques, the destruction of all its commercial
          outlets<br>
          and banking connections throughout the world, and the loss of
          its<br>
          rapidly growing prewar markets. France on the other hand, had
          not<br>
          obtained the one thing it wanted: security.<br>

          The British governments of the Right began to follow a double<br>
          policy: a public policy in which they spoke loudly in support
          of the<br>
          foreign policy of the Left; and a secret policy in which they<br>
          supported the foreign policy of the Right. Thus the stated
          policy was<br>
          based on support of the League of Nations and of disarmament
          yet the<br>
          real policy was quite different. While openly supporting Naval<br>
          disarmament, Britain signed a secret agreement with France
          which<br>
          blocked disarmament and signed an agreement with Germany which<br>
          released her from her naval disarmament in 1935. After 1935,
          the<br>
          contrast between the public and secret policy became so sharp
          that<br>
          Lord Halifax called it "dyarchy."<br>
          <br>
          Page 289<br>
          <br>
          The British Right forced France to give away every advantage<br>
          which it held over Germany. Germany was allowed to rearm in
          1935,<br>
          allowed to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936. Finally, when
          all had<br>
          been lost, public opinion forced the British government to
          abandon the<br>
          Right's policy of appeasement and adopt the old French policy
          of<br>
          resistance made on a poor issue (Poland 1939)<br>
          In France, as in Britain, there appeared a double policy.
          While<br>
          France continued to talk of collective security, this was
          largely for<br>
          public consumption for in fact she had no policy independent
          of<br>
          Britain's policy of appeasement.<br>
          <br>
          Page 290<br>

          War was not outlawed but merely subjected to certain
          procedural<br>
          delays in making it, nor were peaceful procedures for settling<br>
          international disputes made compulsory.<br>
          The Covenant had been worded by a skillful British lawyer,
          Civil<br>
          Hurst, who filled it with loopholes cleverly concealed under a
          mass<br>
          of impressive verbiage so that no state's freedom of action
          was<br>
          vitally restricted.<br>

          The Locarno Pacts, which were presented at the time throughout<br>
          the English-speaking world as a sensational contribution to
          the peace<br>
          and stability of Europe, really formed the background for the
          events<br>
          of 1938 when Czechoslovakia was destroyed at Munich. When the<br>
          guarantee of Locarno became due in 1936, Britain dishonored
          its<br>
          agreement, the Rhine was remilitarized and the way was open
          for<br>
          Germany to move eastward.<br>
          <br>
          Poland protested violently at the refusal to guarantee her<br>
          frontiers.<br>

          <br>
          France agreed to an extension of a multilateral agreement by<br>
          which all countries could renounce the use of war as an
          instrument of<br>
          national policy. The British government reserved certain
          areas,<br>
          notably the Middle East, where it wished to be able to wage
          wars which<br>
          could not be termed self-defense in a strict sense. The US
          also made<br>
          reservation preserving its right to make war under the Monroe<br>
          doctrine. The net result was that only aggressive war was to
          be<br>
          renounced. The Kellogg-Briand Pact took one of the first steps
          toward<br>
          destroying the legal distinction between war and peace, since
          the<br>
          Powers, having renounced the use of war, began towage wars
          without<br>
          declaring them as was done by Japan in China in 1937, by Italy
          in<br>
          Spain in 1936 and by everyone in Korea in 1950.<br>
          <br>
          Page 296<br>
          <br>
          The outlawry of war was relatively meaningless without some<br>
          sanctions that could compel the use of peaceful methods.
          Efforts in<br>
          this direction were nullified by Britain.<br>

          Disarmament suggestions of the Soviet representative,
          Litvinoff,<br>
          providing for immediate and complete disarmament of every
          country, was<br>
          denounced by all. A substitute draft provided that the most
          heavily<br>
          armed states would disarm by 50%, the less heavily-armed by
          31% and<br>
          the lightly armed by 25%, and the disarmed by 0%. That all
          tanks,<br>
          planes, gas and heavy artillery be completely prohibited was
          also<br>
          rejected without discussion and Litvinoff was beseeched to
          show a more<br>
          "constructive spirit."<br>

          Once it was recognized that security was in acute danger,<br>
          financial considerations were ruthlessly subordinated to
          rearmament<br>
          giving rise to an economic boom which showed clearly what
          might have<br>
          been achieved earlier if financial consideration had been
          subordinated<br>
          to the world's economic and social needs earlier; such action
          would<br>
          have provided prosperity and rising standards of living which
          might<br>
          have made rearming unnecessary.<br>

          The preliminary payments were supposed to amount to a total of
          20<br>
          billion marks by May 1921. Although the Entente Powers
          contended<br>
          that only 8 billion had been paid,the whole matter was dropped
          when<br>
          the Germans were presented with a total reparations bill of
          132<br>
          billion marks. Under pressure, Germany accepted this bill and
          gave the<br>
          victors bonds of indebtedness. Of these, 82 billion were set
          aside and<br>
          forgotten. Germany was to pay the other 50 billion at 2.5
          billion a<br>
          year in interest and .5 billion a year to reduce the total
          debt.<br>
          <br>
          JCT: It would only take 200 years to pay off a total of 500<br>
          billion in interest and 50 billion in principal.<br>
          <br>
          Page 306<br>
          <br>
          Germany could only pay if two conditions prevailed:<br>
          <br>
          a) if it had a budgetary surplus and<br>
          b) if it sold abroad more than it bought abroad.<br>
          <br>
          Since neither of these conditions generally existed in the
          period<br>
          1921-1931, Germany could not, in fact, pay reparations.<br>
          The failure to obtain a budgetary surplus was solely the<br>
          responsibility of the government which refused to reduce its
          own<br>
          expenditures or the standards of living off its own people or
          to tax<br>
          them sufficiently heavily. The failure to obtain a favorable
          balance<br>
          of trade because foreign creditors refused to allow a free
          flow of<br>
          German goods into their own countries. Thus creditors were
          unwilling<br>
          to accept payment in the only way in which payments could
          honestly be<br>
          &nbsp;(27 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          made, that is, by accepting German goods and services.<br>
          <br>
          JCT: Notice they wanted money and not the goods they could buy<br>
          with it.<br>
          <br>
          Germany could have paid in real goods and services if the<br>
          creditors had been willing to accept such goods and services.
          The<br>
          government made up the deficits by borrowing from the
          Reichsbank. The<br>
          result was an acute inflation which was not injurious to the<br>
          influential groups though it was generally ruinous to the
          middle<br>
          classes and thus encouraged extremist elements.<br>

          <br>
          On Jan 9,1923, the Reparations Committee voted 3 to 1 (Britain<br>
          opposing France, Belgium and Italy) that Germany was in
          default.<br>
          Armed forces of the three nations began to occupy the Ruhr two<br>
          days later. Germany declared a general strike in the area,
          ceased all<br>
          reparation payments, and adopted a program of passive
          resistance, the<br>
          government supporting the strikers by printing more paper
          money.<br>
          The area occupied was no more than 60 miles long by 30 miles
          wide<br>
          but contained 10% of Germany's population and produced 80% of<br>
          Germany's coal, iron and steel and 70% of her freight traffic.
          Almost<br>
          150,000 Germans were deported.<br>
          <br>
          Page 308<br>
          <br>
          A compromise was reached by which Germany accepted the Dawes
          Plan<br>
          for reparations and the Ruhr was evacuated. The Dawes Plan was
          largely<br>
          a J.P. Morgan production drawn up by an international
          committee of<br>
          financial experts presided over by American banker Charles
          Dawes.<br>
          Germany paid reparations for five years (1924-1929) and owed
          more at<br>
          the end than it had owed at the beginning. It is worthy of
          note that<br>
          this system was set up by the international bankers and that
          the<br>
          subsequent lending of other people's money to Germany was very<br>
          profitable to these bankers.<br>
          <br>
          Using these American loans, Germany's industry was largely<br>
          rebuilt to make it the second best in the world and to pay<br>
          reparations.<br>
          <br>
          Page 309<br>
          <br>
          By these loans Germany's creditors were able to pay their war<br>
          debts to England without sending goods or services. Foreign
          exchange<br>
          went to Germany as loans, back to Italy, Belgium, France and
          Britain<br>
          as reparations and finally back to the US as payments on war
          debts. In<br>
          that period, Germany paid 10.5 billion marks in reparations
          but<br>
          borrowed 18.6 billion abroad. Nothing was settled by all this
          but the<br>
          international bankers sat in heaven under a rain of fees and<br>
          commissions.<br>
          <br>
          Page 310<br>
          <br>
          The Dawes Plan was replaced by the Young Plan, named after the<br>
          American Owen Young (a Morgan agent). A new private bank
          called the<br>
          Bank for International Settlements was established in
          Switzerland.<br>
          Owned by the chief central banks of the world and holding
          accounts for<br>
          each of them, "a Central Bankers' Bank," it allowed payments
          to be<br>
          made by merely shifting credits from one country's account to
          another<br>
          on the books of the bank.<br>
          <br>
          The Young Plan lasted for less than 18 months. The crash of
          the<br>
          New York stock market in 1929 marked the end of the decade of<br>
          reconstruction and ended the American loans to Germany.<br>
          Germans and others had begun a "flight from the mark" which<br>
          created a great drain on the German gold reserve. As it
          dwindled, the<br>
          volume of money and credit erected on that reserve had to be
          reduced<br>
          by raising the interest rate. Prices fell because of the
          reduced money<br>
          supply so that it became almost impossible for the banks to
          sell<br>
          collateral to obtain funds to meet the growing demand for
          money.<br>

          On May 8, 1931, the largest Austrian bank, the Credit-Anstalt
          (a<br>
          Rothschild institution) which controlled 70% of Austria's
          industry,<br>
          announced a $140 million schillings loss. The true loss was
          over a<br>
          billion and the bank had been insolvent for years. The
          Rothschilds and<br>
          the Austrian government gave the Credit-Anstalt 160 million to
          cover<br>
          the loss but public confidence had been destroyed. A run began
          on the<br>
          bank. To meet this run,the Austrian banks called in all the
          funds they<br>
          had in German banks. The German banks began to collapse. These
          latter<br>
          began to call in all their funds in London. The London banks
          began to<br>
          fall and gold flowed outward. On Sept.21, England was forced
          off the<br>
          gold standard. The Reichsbank lost 200 million marks of its
          gold<br>
          reserve in the first week of June and a billion in the second.
          The<br>
          discount rate was raised step by step to 15% without stopping
          the loss<br>
          of reserves but destroying the activities of the German
          industrial<br>
          system almost completely.<br>
          <br>
          Germany begged for relief on her reparations payments but her<br>
          creditors were reluctant unless they obtained similar relief
          on the<br>
          war-debt payments to the US. The President suggested a
          moratorium for<br>
          one year if its debtors would extend the same privilege to
          their<br>
          debtors.<br>

          At the June 1932 Lausanne Conference, German reparations were
          cut<br>
          to a total of only 3 billion marks but the agreement was never<br>
          ratified because of the refusal of the US Congress to cut war
          debts<br>
          equally drastically. In 1933, Hitler repudiated all
          reparations.<br>

          The outbreak of war in 1914 showed these financial capitalists
          in<br>
          their worst, narrow in outlook, ignorant and selfish, while<br>
          proclaiming, as usual, their total devotion to the social
          good. They<br>
          generally agreed that war could not go on for more than six to
          ten<br>
          months because of the "limited financial resources" of the<br>
          belligerents (by which they meant gold reserves).This idea
          reveals the<br>
          fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and of money on the
          part of<br>
          the very persons who were reputed to be experts on the
          subject. Wars<br>
          are not fought with gold or even with money but by proper
          organization<br>
          of real resources.<br>
          <br>
          The attitudes of bakers were revealed most clearly in England,<br>
          where every move was dictated by efforts to protect their own
          position<br>
          and to profit from it rather than by considerations of<br>
          economic mobilization for war or the welfare of the British
          people.<br>
          War found the British banking system insolvent in the sense
          that its<br>
          funds, created by the banking system for profit and rented out
          to the<br>
          economic system to permit it to operate, could not be covered
          by the<br>
          existing volume of gold reserves or collateral which could be<br>
          liquidated rapidly. Accordingly,the bankers secretly devised a
          scheme<br>
          by which their obligations could be met by fiat money
          (so-called<br>
          Treasury Notes), but as soon as the crisis was over, they ten
          insisted<br>
          that the government must pay for the war without recourse to
          fiat<br>
          money (which was always damned by the bankers as immoral) but
          by<br>
          taxation and by borrowing at high interest rates from the
          bankers. The<br>
          decision to use Treasury Notes to fulfill the bankers'
          liabilities was<br>
          &nbsp;(29 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          made on July 25, 1915 by Sir John Bradbury. the first Treasury
          Notes<br>
          were run off the presses at Waterloo and Sons on July 28th. It
          was<br>
          announced that the Treasury Notes, instead of gold, would be
          used for<br>
          bank payments. The discount rate was raised at the Bank of
          England<br>
          from 3% to 10% to prevent inflation, a figure taken merely
          because the<br>
          traditional rule of the bank stated that a 10% bank rate would
          draw<br>
          gold out of the ground itself.<br>
          <br>
          Page 317<br>
          <br>
          At the outbreak of war, most of the belligerent countries<br>
          suspended gold payments and accepted their bankers' advice
          that the<br>
          proper way to pay for the war was by a combination of bank
          loans and<br>
          taxation of consumption. The governments paid for the war by
          taxation,<br>
          by fiat money, by borrowing from banks (which created credit
          for the<br>
          purpose) and by borrowing from the people by selling them war
          bonds.<br>
          Each of these methods had a different effect upon the two<br>
          consequences of the war: inflation and public debt.<br>
          <br>
          a) Taxation gives no inflation and no debt.<br>
          b) Fiat money gives inflation and no debt.<br>
          c) Bank credit gives inflation and debt.<br>
          d) Sales of bonds give no inflation but give debt.<br>
          <br>
          It would appear from this table that the best way to pay for
          the<br>
          war would be by taxation and the worst way would be by bank
          credit.<br>
          Probably the best way to finance war is a combination of the
          four<br>
          methods.<br>
          <br>
          Page 318<br>
          <br>
          In the period 1914-1918, the various belligerents used a
          mixture<br>
          of these four methods but it was a mixture dictated by
          expediency and<br>
          false theories so that at the end of the war all countries
          found<br>
          themselves with both public debts and inflation.<br>
          <br>
          While the prices in most countries rose 200 to 300 percent and<br>
          public debts rose 1000%, the financial leaders tried to keep
          up the<br>
          pretense that the money was as valuable as it had ever been.
          For this<br>
          reason, they did not openly abandon the gold standard.
          Instead, they<br>
          suspended certain attributes of the gold standard. In most
          countries,<br>
          payments in gold and export of gold were suspended but every
          effort<br>
          was made to keep gold reserves up to a respectable percentage
          of<br>
          notes. These attributes were achieved in some cases by
          deceptive<br>
          methods. In Britain, the gold reserves against notes fell from
          52% to<br>
          18% in the month of July 1914; then the situation was
          concealed,<br>
          partly by moving assets of local banks into the Bank of
          England and<br>
          using them as reserves for both, partly by issuing a new kind
          of notes<br>
          (Currency Notes) which had no real reserve and little gold
          backing.<br>
          <br>
          Page 320<br>
          <br>
          As soon as the war was over, governments began to turn their<br>
          attention to restoring the prewar financial system. Since the<br>
          essential element was believed to be the gold standard, this
          movement<br>
          was called "stabilization."<br>
          Productive capacity in both agriculture and industry had been<br>
          increased by the artificial demand of the war period to a
          degree far<br>
          beyond the ability of normal domestic demand to buy the
          products.<br>
          <br>
          JCT: But not to eat them.<br>
          <br>
          The backwards areas had increased their outputs of raw
          materials<br>
          and food so greatly that the total could hardly have been
          sold.<br>
          <br>
          JCT: But no eaten.<br>
          <br>
          The result was as situation where all countries were eager to<br>
          sell and reluctant to buy. The only sensible solution to this
          problem<br>
          of excessive productive capacity would have been a substantial
          rise in<br>
          domestic standards of living but this would have required a<br>
          fundamental reapportionment of the national income so that
          claims to<br>
          &nbsp;(30 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          this product of the excess capacity would go to those masses
          eager to<br>
          consume, rather than continue to go to the minority desiring
          to save.<br>
          Such reform was rejected by the ruling groups in both
          "advanced" and<br>
          "backwards" countries so that this solution was reached only
          to a<br>
          small degree in a relatively few countries (chiefly US and
          Germany in<br>
          1925-1929).<br>

          The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching<br>
          aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial
          control<br>
          in private hands able to dominate the political system of each
          country<br>
          and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be<br>
          controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the
          world<br>
          acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent
          private<br>
          meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the
          Bank<br>
          for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private
          bank<br>
          owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were<br>
          themselves private corporations. Each central bank sought to
          dominate<br>
          its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to
          manipulate<br>
          foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity
          in the<br>
          country, and to influence cooperative politicians by
          subsequent<br>
          economic rewards in the business world.<br>
          <br>
          In each country, the power of the central bank rested largely
          on<br>
          its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a
          whole the<br>
          power of the central bankers rested very largely on their
          control<br>
          of loans and the gold flows. They made agreements on all the
          major<br>
          financial problems of the world, as well as on many of the<br>
          economic and political problems, especially in reference to
          loans,<br>
          payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the
          globe.<br>
          The Bank of International Settlements, B.I.S. is generally<br>
          regarded as the apex of the structure of financial capitalism
          whose<br>
          remote origins go back to the creation of the Bank of England
          in 1694.<br>
          <br>
          Page 325<br>
          <br>
          It was set up to be the world cartel of every-growing national<br>
          financial powers by assembling the nominal heads of these
          national<br>
          financial centers.<br>
          <br>
          The commander in Chief of the world system of banking control
          was<br>
          Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built
          up by<br>
          the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an
          oracle<br>
          in all matters of government and business. In government, the
          power of<br>
          the Bank of England was a considerable restriction on
          political action<br>
          as early as 1819 but an effort to break this power by a
          modification<br>
          of the bank's charter in1844 failed. In 1852, Gladstone, then<br>
          chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister,
          declared,<br>
          "The hinge of the whole situation was this: the government
          itself was<br>
          not to be a substantive power in matters of Finance, but was
          to leave<br>
          the Money Power supreme and unquestioned."<br>
          <br>
          This power of the Bank of England was admitted in 1924 by<br>
          Reginald McKenna, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer,
          when he,<br>
          as Chairman, told the stockholders of the Midland bank, "I am
          afraid<br>
          the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks
          can, and<br>
          do, create money. And they who control the credit of a nation
          direct<br>
          the policy if Governments and hold in the hollow of their
          hands the<br>
          destiny of the people." In that same year, Sir Drummond
          Fraser, vice president<br>
          of the Institute of Bankers stated, "The Governor must be<br>
          the autocrat who dictates the terms upon which alone the
          Government<br>
          can obtain borrowed money." On Sep. 26, 1921,<br>
          Vincent Vickers, director of the bank, the Financial Times
          wrote,<br>
          "Half a dozen meant the top of the Big Five Banks could upset
          the<br>
          whole fabric of government by refraining from renewing
          Treasury<br>
          Bills."<br>

          Norman had no use for governments and feared democracy. Both<br>
          of these seemed to him to be threats to private banking and
          thus to<br>
          all that was proper and precious to human life. He viewed his
          life as<br>
          a kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of unsound
          money<br>
          which were in league with anarchy and Communism. When he
          rebuilt the<br>
          Bank of England,he constructed it as a fortress prepared to
          defend<br>
          itself against any popular revolt. For much of his life, he<br>
          rushed about the world under the assumed name of "Professor
          Skinner."<br>
          Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first<br>
          governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong owed
          his<br>
          career to the favor of the Morgan bank.<br>
          <br>
          In the 1920s, they were determined to use the financial power
          of<br>
          Britain and the US to force all the major countries of the
          world to go<br>
          on the gold standard and to operate it through central banks
          free from<br>
          all political control, with all questions of international
          finance to<br>
          be settled by agreements by such central banks without
          interference<br>
          from governments.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief<br>
          central banks were themselves substantive powers in world
          finance.<br>
          They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of
          the<br>
          dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had
          raised<br>
          them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The<br>
          substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of<br>
          investment bankers (also called "international" or "merchant"
          bankers)<br>
          who remained largely behind the scenes in their own
          unincorporated<br>
          private banks.<br>
          <br>
          These formed system of international cooperation and national<br>
          dominance which was more private,more powerful, and more
          secret tan<br>
          that of their agents in the central banks. This dominance of<br>
          investment bankers was based on their control over the flows
          of credit<br>
          and investment funds in their own countries and throughout the
          world.<br>
          They could dominate the financial and industrial systems of
          their own<br>
          countries by their influence over the flow of current funds

          debts;<br>
          they could dominate governments by their control over current<br>
          government loans and the play of the international exchanges.<br>
          Almost all of this power was exercised by the personal
          influence<br>
          and prestige men who had demonstrated their ability in the
          past to<br>
          bring off successful financial coups, to keep their word, to
          remain<br>
          cool in a crisis, and to share their winning opportunities
          with their<br>
          associates.<br>
          In this system, the Rothschilds had been preeminent during
          much<br>
          of the nineteenth century, but, at the end of that century,
          they were<br>
          being replaced by J.P. Morgan in New York.<br>
          At the present stage, we must follow the efforts of the
          central<br>
          bankers to compel the world to return to the gold standard of
          1914.<br>

          The problem of public debts arose from the fact that as money<br>
          (credit) was created, it was usually made in such a way that
          it was<br>
          not in the control of the state but was in the control of
          private<br>
          financial institutions which demanded real wealth at some
          future date<br>
          for the creation of claims on wealth in the present. The
          problem of<br>
          public debt could have been met in one or more of several
          fashions:<br>
          a) by increasing the amount of real wealth...<br>
          b) by devaluation...<br>
          c) by repudiation...<br>
          d) by taxation...<br>
          e) by the issuance of fiat money and the payment of the debt
          by such<br>
          money.<br>

          Efforts to pay the public debt by fiat money would have made
          the<br>
          inflation problem worse.<br>
          Orthodox theory rejected fiat money as solutions to the
          problem.<br>

          In Britain, the currency notes which had been used to
          supplement<br>
          bank notes were retired and credit was curtailed by raising
          the<br>
          discount rate to panic level. The results were horrible.
          Business<br>
          activity fell drastically and unemployment rose to well over a
          million<br>
          and a half. The outcome was a great wave of strikes and
          industrial<br>
          unrest.<br>
          <br>
          Page 333<br>
          <br>
          To maintain the gold reserve at all, it was necessary to keep<br>
          the discount rate at a level so high (4.5% or more) that
          business<br>
          activity was discouraged. As a result of this financial
          policy,<br>
          Britain found herself faced with deflation and depression for
          the<br>
          whole period of 1920-1923. The number of unemployed averaged
          about<br>
          1.75 millions for each of the thirteen years of 1921-1932 and
          reached<br>
          3 million in 1931.<br>
          <br>
          Belgium, France and Italy, accepted orthodox financial ideas
          and<br>
          tried to deflate in 1920-1921 but after the depression which
          resulted,<br>
          they gave up the task.<br>

          Financial capitalism had little interest in goods at all, but
          was<br>
          concerned entirely with claims on wealth - stocks, bonds,
          mortgages,<br>
          insurance, proxies, interest rates, and such. It built
          railroads in<br>
          order to sell securities, not to transport goods. Corporations
          were<br>
          built upon corporations in the form of holding companies so
          that<br>
          securities were issued in huge quantities bringing profitable
          fees and<br>
          commissions to financial capitalists without any increase in
          economic<br>
          production whatever. Indeed, these financial capitalists
          discovered<br>
          that they could not only make killings out of the issuing of
          such<br>
          securities,they could also make killings out of the bankruptcy
          of such<br>
          corporations through the fees and commissions of
          reorganization. A<br>
          very pleasant cycle of flotation, bankruptcy, flotation,
          bankruptcy<br>
          began to be practiced by these financial capitalists. The more<br>
          excessive the flotation, the greater the profits and the more
          imminent<br>
          the bankruptcy. The more frequent the bankruptcy, the greater
          the<br>
          profits of reorganization and the sooner the opportunity of
          another<br>
          excessive flotation.<br>
          <br>
          Page 337<br>
          <br>
          The growth of financial capitalism made possible a
          centralization<br>
          of world economic control and a use of this power for the
          direct<br>
          benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other
          economic<br>
          groups. Financial control could be exercised only imperfectly
          through<br>
          credit control and interlocking directorates.<br>

          The real key rested on the control of money flows which were

          THE PERIOD OF DEFLATION, 1927-1936<br>
          <br>
          Page 339<br>
          <br>
          After 1929, deflation reached a degree which could be called<br>
          acute. In the first part of this period (1921-1925), the
          dangerous<br>
          economic implications of deflation were concealed by a
          structure of<br>
          self-deception which pretended that a great period of economic<br>
          progress would be inaugurated as soon as the task of
          stabilization had<br>
          been accomplished. This psychological optimism was completely<br>
          &nbsp;(33 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          unwarranted by the economic facts. After 1925, when deflation
          became<br>
          more deep-rooted and economic conditions worsened, the danger
          from<br>
          these conditions was concealed by a continuation of
          unwarranted<br>
          optimism.<br>

          <br>
          Page 342<br>
          <br>
          When France stabilized the franc at a level at which it was<br>
          devalued, the Bank of France sold francs in return for foreign<br>
          exchange. The francs were created as credit in France thus
          giving an<br>
          inflationary effect.<br>

          <br>
          The financial results of the stock market book in the U<br>
          S was credit diverted from production to speculation and
          increasing<br>
          amounts of funds being drained from the economic system into
          the stock<br>
          market where they circulated around and around, building up
          prices<br>
          of securities.<br>
          <br>
          Page 344<br>
          <br>
          Early in 1929, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve<br>
          System became alarmed at the stock market speculations
          draining credit<br>
          from industrial production. To curtail this, they called upon
          member<br>
          banks to reduce their loans on stock collateral to reduce the
          amount<br>
          of credit available for speculation. Instead, the available
          credit<br>
          went more and more to speculation and decreasingly to
          productive<br>
          business. Call money rates in New York which had reached 7% at
          the end<br>
          of 1928 were at 13% by June 1929.<br>
          <br>
          Page 346<br>
          <br>
          To restore confidence among the wealthy (who were causing the<br>
          panic) an effort was made to balance the budget by cutting
          public<br>
          expenditures drastically. This, by reducing purchasing power,
          had<br>
          injurious effects on business activity and increased unrest
          among the<br>
          masses of the people.<br>

          The Thomas Amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933)<br>
          gave the president the power to devaluate the dollar up to
          50%, to<br>
          issue up to $3 billion fiat money,and to engage on an
          extensive<br>
          program of public spending.<br>

          Page 352<br>
          <br>
          The economies of the different countries were so intertwined
          with<br>
          one another that any policy of self-interest on the part of
          one would<br>
          be sure to injure others in the short run and the country in
          the<br>
          long run. The international and domestic economic systems had<br>
          developed to the point where the customary methods of thought
          and<br>
          procedure in regard to them were obsolete.<br>
          <br>
          page 353<br>
          <br>
          As a result of the crisis, regardless of the nature of its<br>
          primary impact, all countries began to pursue policies of
          economic<br>
          nationalism. This spread rapidly as a result of imitation and<br>
          retaliation.<br>

          The Bank of France raised its discount rate from 2.5% to 6% in<br>
          1935 with depressing economic results. In this way, the strain
          on gold<br>
          was relieved at the cost of increased depression. The Right
          discovered<br>
          that it could veto any actions of the Left government merely
          by<br>
          exporting capital from France.<br>

          The franc passed through a series of depreciations and partial<br>

          France torn for years by industrial unrest and class
          struggles. The<br>
          &nbsp;(34 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          government was subjected to systematic blackmail by the
          well-to-do<br>
          of the country because of the ability of these persons to
          prevent<br>
          social reform, public spending, arming, or any policy of
          decision by<br>
          selling francs.<br>

          The historical importance of the banker-engendered
          deflationary<br>
          crisis of 1927-1940 can hardly be overestimated. It gave a
          blow to<br>
          democracy and to the parliamentary system and thus became a
          chief<br>
          cause of World War II. It so hampered the Powers which
          remained<br>
          democratic by its orthodox economic theories that these were
          unable to<br>
          rearm for defence. It gave rise to a conflict between the
          theorists of<br>
          orthodox and unorthodox financial methods.<br>
          <br>
          The bankers' formula for treating a depression was by clinging
          to<br>
          the gold standard, by raising interest rates and seeking
          deflation,<br>
          and by insisting on a reduction in public spending, a fiscal
          surplus<br>
          or at least a balanced budget.<br>
          <br>
          These ideas were rejected totally, on a point by point basis,
          by<br>
          the unorthodox economists, (somewhat mistakenly called
          Keynesian). The<br>
          bankers' formula sought to encourage economic recovery by
          "restoring<br>
          confidence in the value of money," that is, their own
          confidence in<br>
          what was the primary concern of bankers.<br>
          <br>
          The unorthodox theorists sought to restore purchasing power by<br>
          increasing, instead of reducing, the money supply and by
          placing it in<br>
          the hands of potential consumers rather than in the banks or
          in the<br>
          hands of investors.<br>

          The whole relationship of money and resources remained a
          puzzle<br>
          to many and was still a subject of debate in the 1950s but at
          least a<br>
          great victory had been won by man in his control of his own
          destiny<br>
          when the myths of orthodox financial theory were finally
          challenged in<br>
          the 1930s.<br>

          half<br>

          As a result of the failure of most countries (excepting
          Germany<br>
          and Russia) to achieve full utilization of resources, it was
          possible<br>
          to devote increasing percentages of resources to armaments
          without<br>
          suffering any decline in the standards of living.<br>

          It was discovered by Germany in 1932, by Italy in 1934, by
          Japan<br>
          in 1936 and by the United States in 1938 that deflation could
          be<br>
          prevented by rearming.<br>

          <br>
          The period of reflation after 1933 was caused by increases in<br>
          public spending on armaments. In most countries,the transition
          from<br>
          reflation to inflation did not occur until after they had
          entered the<br>
          war. Germany was the chief exception and possibly also Italy
          and<br>
          Russia, since all of these were making fairly full utilization
          of<br>
          their resources. In France and the other countries overrun by<br>
          Germany, such full mobilization of resources was not achieved
          before<br>
          they were defeated.<br>

          The Post Second World War economy was entirely different in<br>
          character from that of the 1920s following the First World
          War. This<br>
          was most notable in the absence of a post-war depression which
          was<br>
          widely expected but which did not arrive because there was no
          effort<br>
          to stabilize on a gold standard. The major difference was the
          eclipse<br>
          of the bankers who have been largely reduced in status from
          the<br>
          masters to the servants of the economic system. This has been
          brought<br>
          about by the new concern with real economic factors instead of
          with<br>
          financial counters, as previously. As part of this program,
          there has<br>
          been a great reduction in the economic role of gold.<br>

          <br>
          Industrialism, especially in its early years, brought with it<br>
          social and economic conditions which were admittedly horrible.
          Human<br>
          beings were brought together around factories to form great
          new cities<br>
          which were sordid and unsanitary. In many cases, these persons
          were<br>
          reduced to conditions of animality, which shock the
          imagination.<br>
          Crowded together in want and disease, with no leisure and no
          security,<br>
          completely dependent on weekly wage which was less than a
          pittance,<br>
          they worked twelve to fifteen hours a day for six days in the
          week<br>
          among dusty and dangerous machines with no protection against<br>
          inevitable accidents, disease, or old age, and returned at
          night to<br>
          crowded rooms without adequate food and lacking light, fresh
          air,<br>
          heat, pure water, or sanitation. These conditions have been
          described<br>
          for us in the writings of novelists such as Dickens in
          England, Hugo<br>
          or Zola in France.<br>

          The Socialist movement was a reaction against these deplorable<br>
          conditions to the working masses. It has been customary to
          divide this<br>
          movement into two parts at the year 1848, the publication of
          the<br>
          Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx. This work began with the
          ominous<br>
          sentence, "A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of
          Communism,"<br>
          and ended with the trumpet blast "Workers of the world,
          unite."<br>
          In general, the former division believed that man was innately<br>
          good and that all coercive power was bad, with public
          authority the<br>
          worst form of such coercive power. All the world's evils,
          according to<br>
          the anarchists, arose because man's innate goodness was
          corrupted and<br>
          distorted by coercive power. The remedy, they felt, was to
          destroy the<br>
          state. The simplest way to destroy the state would be to
          assassinate<br>
          the chief of the state to ignite a wholesale uprising of
          oppressed<br>
          humanity.<br>
          <br>
          Page 377<br>
          <br>
          Syndicalism was a somewhat more realistic and later version of<br>
          anarchism. It was equally determined to abolish all public
          authority.<br>
          The state would be destroyed by a general strike and replaced
          by a<br>
          flexible federation of free associations of workers.<br>
          The second group of radical social theorists wished to widen
          the<br>
          power and scope of governments by giving them a dominant role
          in<br>
          economic life. The group divided into two chief schools: The<br>
          Socialists and the Communists.<br>
          <br>
          Page 378<br>
          <br>
          From Ricardo, Marx derived the theory that the value of
          economic<br>
          goods was based on the amount of labor put into them.<br>
          <br>
          Page 379<br>
          <br>
          Marx built up a complicated theory which believed that all<br>
          history is the history of class struggles.<br>
          The money which the bourgeoisie took from the proletariat in
          the<br>
          economic system made it possible for them to dominate the
          political<br>
          system, including the police and the army. From such
          exploitation, the<br>
          bourgeoisie would become richer and richer and fewer and fewer
          in<br>
          &nbsp;(36 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          numbers and acquire ownership of all property in the society
          while the<br>
          proletariat would become poorer and poorer and more and more
          numerous<br>
          and be driven closer and closer to desperation. Eventually,
          the latter<br>
          would rise up and take over.<br>
          <br>
          Page 381<br>
          <br>
          In fact, what occurred was could be pictured as cooperative<br>
          effort by unionized workers and monopolized industry to
          exploit<br>
          unorganized consumers by raising prices higher and higher,
          quite<br>
          contrary to the expectations of Marx. Where he had expected<br>
          impoverishment of the masses and concentration of ownership
          with<br>
          gradual elimination of the middle classes, there occurred
          instead<br>
          rising standards of living, dispersal of ownership , a
          relative<br>
          decrease in the numbers of laborers, and a great increase in
          the<br>
          middle classes. Due to income and inheritance taxes, the rich
          became<br>
          poorer and poorer, relatively speaking.<br>

          The new government forced the abdication of the czar. The more<br>
          radical Socialists had been released from prison or had been
          returned<br>
          from exile (in some cases, such as Lenin, by German
          assistance)<br>

          Lenin campaigned to replace the Provisional Government with a<br>
          system of Soviets and to adopt an immediate program of peace
          and land<br>
          distribution. The Bolshevik group seized the centers of
          government in<br>
          St. Petersburg and within 24 hours, issued a series of decrees
          which<br>
          abolished the Provisional government, ordered the end of the
          war with<br>
          Germany and the distribution of large land holdings to the
          peasants.<br>
          <br>
          Page 387<br>
          <br>
          By 1920 industrial production in general was about 13% of the<br>
          1913 figure. At the same time, paper money was printed so
          freely to<br>
          pay for the costs of war, civil war, and the operation of the<br>
          government that prices rose rapidly and the ruble became
          almost<br>
          worthless.<br>
          <br>
          The secret police (Cheka) systematically murdered all real or<br>
          potential opponents.<br>
          <br>
          Page 388<br>
          <br>
          Various outsider Powers also intervened in the Russian chaos.<br>
          An allied expeditionary force invaded northern Russia from
          Murmansk<br>
          and Archangel, while a force of Japanese and another of
          Americans<br>
          landed at Vladivostok and pushed westward for hundreds of
          miles. The<br>
          British seized the oil fields of the Caspian region (late
          1918) while<br>
          the French occupied parts of the Ukraine about Odessa (March
          1919).<br>
          By 1920, Russia was in complete confusion. Poland invaded
          Russia<br>
          occupying much of the Ukraine.<br>
          <br>
          Page 389<br>
          <br>
          As part of this system, not only were all agricultural crops<br>
          considered to be government property but all private trade and<br>
          commerce were also forbidden; the banks were nationalized
          while all<br>
          industrial plants of over five workers and all craft
          enterprises of<br>
          over ten workers were nationalized. This culminated in peasant<br>
          uprisings and urban riots. Within a week, peasant
          requisitioning was<br>
          abandoned in favor of a "New Economic Policy" of free
          commercial<br>
          activity in agriculture and other commodities, with the<br>
          re-establishment of the profit motive and of private ownership
          in<br>
          small industries and in small landholding.<br>

          The Bolsheviks insisted that the distribution of income in a<br>
          capitalistic society would become so inequitable that the
          masses of<br>
          &nbsp;(37 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          the people would not obtain sufficient income to buy the goods
          being<br>
          produced by the industrial plants. As such unsold goods
          accumulated<br>
          with decreasing profits and deepening depression, there would
          be a<br>
          shift toward the production of armaments to provide profits
          and<br>
          produce goods which could be sold and there would be an
          increasingly<br>
          aggressive foreign policy in order to obtain markets for
          unsold goods<br>
          in backward and undeveloped countries. Such aggressive
          imperialism<br>
          would inevitably make Russia a target of aggression in order
          to<br>
          prevent a successful Communist system there from becoming an<br>
          attractive model for the discontented proletariat in
          capitalistic<br>
          countries.<br>
          <br>
          Page 396<br>
          <br>
          Communism in Russia alone required that the country must be<br>
          industrialized with breakneck speed and must emphasize heavy
          industry<br>
          and armaments rather than rising standards of living. This
          meant that<br>
          goods produced by the peasants must be taken from them by
          political<br>
          duress, without any economic return, and that the ultimate in<br>
          authoritarian terror must be used to prevent the peasants from
          reducing<br>
          their level of production. It was necessary to crush all kinds
          of<br>
          foreign espionage, resistance to the Bolshevik state,
          independent<br>
          thought, or public discontent.<br>
          <br>
          Page 397<br>
          <br>
          Stalin forced the peasants off their land. In the space of six<br>
          weeks, (Feb-Mar 1930) collective farms increased from 59,400
          with 4.4<br>
          million families to 110,200 farms with 14.3 million families.
          All<br>
          peasants who resisted were treated with violence; their
          property was<br>
          confiscated, they were beaten or sent into exile in remote
          areas; many<br>
          were killed. This process, known as "the liquidation of the
          kulaks"<br>
          affected five million kulak families. Rather than give up
          their<br>
          animals, many peasants killed them. The number of cattle was
          reduced<br>
          from 30.7 million in 1928 to 19.6 million in 1933. The
          planting<br>
          season of 1930 was entirely disrupted. Three million peasants<br>
          starved in 1931-1933. Stalin told Churchill that 12 million
          died in<br>
          this reorganization of agriculture.<br>
          <br>
          Page 401<br>
          <br>
          The privileged rulers and their favorites had the best of<br>
          everything obtained, however at a terrible price, at the cost
          of<br>
          complete insecurity for even the highest party officials were
          under<br>
          constant surveillance and would be inevitably purged to exile
          or<br>
          death.<br>
          <br>
          The growth of inequality was embodied in law. All restrictions
          on<br>
          maximum salaries were removed. Special stores were established
          where<br>
          the privileged could obtain scarce goods at low prices;
          restaurants<br>
          with different menus were set up in industrial plants for
          different<br>
          levels of employees; housing discrimination became steadily
          wider.<br>
          <br>
          Page 402<br>
          <br>
          As public discontent and social tensions grew, the use of
          spying,<br>
          purges, torture and murder increased out of all proportion.
          Every wave<br>
          of discontent resulted in new waves of police activity.
          Hundreds of<br>
          thousands were killed while millions were arrested and exiled
          to<br>
          Siberia or put into huge slave-labor camps. Estimates vary
          from two<br>
          million as high as twenty million.<br>
          <br>
          Page 403<br>
          <br>
          For every leader who was publicly eliminated, thousands were<br>
          eliminated in secret. By 1939, all the leaders of Bolshivism
          had been<br>
          driven from public life and most had died violent deaths.<br>
          There were two networks of secret-police spies, unknown to
          each<br>
          other, one serving the special department of the factory while
          the<br>
          other reported to a high level of the secret police outside.<br>
          <br>
          Page 404<br>
          <br>
          Whenever the secret police needed more money it could sweep
          large<br>
          &nbsp;(38 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          numbers of persons, without trial or notice, into its wage
          deduction<br>
          system or into its labor camps to be hired out. It would seem
          that the<br>
          secret police were the real rulers of Russia. This was true
          except at<br>
          the very top where Stalin could always liquidate the head by
          having<br>
          him arrested by his second in command in return for Stalin's
          promise<br>
          to promote the arrester to the top position. In this way, the
          chiefs<br>
          of the secret police were successively eliminated.<br>

          The German thirst for the coziness of a totalitarian way of
          life<br>
          is the key to German national character. Decision, which
          requires the<br>
          evaluation of alternatives, drives man to individualism,
          self-reliance<br>
          and rationalism, all hateful qualities to Germanism.<br>

          They wanted a cozy society which would so absorb the
          individual<br>
          in its structure that he would never need to make significant<br>
          decisions for himself. Held within a framework of known,
          satisfying<br>
          personal relationships, such an individual would be safe
          because he<br>
          would be surrounded by fellows equally satisfied with their
          own<br>
          positions, each feeling important from his membership in the
          greater<br>
          whole.<br>

          The German abhors the need to make decisions. He feels it<br>
          necessary to proclaim his position by verbal loudness which
          may seem<br>
          boastful to outsiders.<br>
          <br>

          Germans are ill-at-ease with equality, democracy,
          individualism,<br>
          freedom, and other features of modern life. Their neurological
          systems<br>
          were a consequence of the coziness of German childhood, which,<br>
          contrary to popular impression, was not a condition of misery
          and<br>
          personal cruelty (as it often is in England) but a warm,
          affectionate<br>
          and externally disciplined situation of secure relationships.<br>
          The Englishman is disciplined from within so that he takes his<br>
          self-discipline, embedded in his neurological system, with him<br>
          wherever he goes. The Englishman is the most socialized of
          Europeans,<br>
          as the Frenchman is the most civilized, the Italian most
          completely<br>
          gregarious, or the Spaniard most completely individualistic.
          But the<br>
          German, by seeking external discipline, shows his unconscious
          desire<br>
          to recapture the externally disciplined world of his
          childhood. With<br>
          such discipline he may be the best behaved of citizens, but
          without<br>
          it, he may be a beast.<br>
          <br>
          He sees no need to make any effort to see anything from any
          point<br>
          of view other than his own. The consequence is a most damaging<br>
          inability to do this. His union, his neighborhood are the best
          and all<br>
          others may be denigrated. His myopic or narrow-angled vision
          of the<br>
          &nbsp;(39 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          universe must be universalized.<br>

          The precarious structure left by Bismarck was not managed but<br>
          merely hidden from public view by a facade of nationalistic,<br>
          anti foreign, anti-Semitic, imperialistic, and chauvinistic
          propaganda<br>
          of which the emperor was the center.<br>
          <br>
          The monarchy represented the body, which was supported by four<br>
          legs: the army, the landlords, the bureaucracy and the
          industrialists.<br>
          The revolution of 1918 was not really a revolution at all
          because it<br>
          removed the monarchy but it left the quartet of legs.<br>

          The German inflation, which was a great benefit to the
          Quartet,<br>
          destroyed the economic position of the middle classes and
          lower middle<br>
          classes and permanently alienated them from the republic.<br>

          The Nationalist Party built up a pervasive propaganda campaign
          to<br>
          show that all Germany's problems were caused by the democratic
          and<br>
          laboring groups, by the internationalists, and by the Jews.<br>
          <br>
          Page 428<br>
          <br>
          The Centre and Left shared this nationalistic poison
          sufficiently<br>
          to abstain from any effort to give the German people the true
          story of<br>
          Germany's responsibility for the war and for her own
          hardships. Thus<br>
          the Right was able to spread its own story of the war, that
          Germany<br>
          had been overcome by a "stab in the back" from "the three<br>
          Internationals": the "Gold" International of the Jews, the
          "Red"<br>
          International of the Socialists, and the "Black" International
          of the<br>
          Catholics, an unholy triple alliance which was symbolized in
          the gold,<br>
          red, and black flag of the Weimar Republic. Every effort was
          made to<br>
          divert popular animosity at the defeat of 1918 and the
          Versailles<br>
          settlement from those who were really responsible to the
          democratic<br>
          and republican groups. At the same time, German animosity
          against<br>
          economic exploitation was directed away from the landlords and<br>
          industrialists by racist doctrines which blamed all such
          problems on<br>
          bad Jewish international bankers and department store owners.<br>

          The Nazi drive to build up a mass following was kept alive by
          the<br>
          financial contributions of the Quartet. The Nazis were
          financed by the<br>
          Black Reichswehr from 1919-1923, then this support ceased but
          was<br>
          compensated for by the support of the industrialists, who
          financed the<br>
          Nazis from Hitler's exit from prison in 1924 to the end of
          1932.<br>
          <br>
          The destruction of the Weimar Republic has five stages:<br>
          <br>
          1) Bruning: March 24 1930 - May 30 1932<br>
          2) Von Papen: May 31 1932 - November 14 1932<br>
          3) Schleicher: December 2 1932 - January 28 1933<br>
          4) Hitler: January 30 1933 - March 5 1933<br>
          5) Gleichschaltung: March 6 1933 - August 2 1934<br>
          <br>
          When the economic crisis began in 1929, Germany had a
          democratic<br>
          government of the Center and Social Democratic parties. The
          crisis<br>
          resulted in a decrease in tax receipts and a parallel increase
          in<br>
          demands for government welfare services. This brought to a
          head the<br>
          latent dispute over orthodox and unorthodox financing of a
          depression.<br>
          Big business and big finance were determined to place the
          burden of<br>
          the depression on the working classes by forcing the
          government to<br>
          adopt a policy of deflation - that is, by wage reductions and<br>
          curtailment of government expenditures. The Social Democrats
          wavered<br>
          in their attitude but in general were opposed to this policy.
          Schacht,<br>
          as president of the Reichsbank, was able to force the
          Socialist Rudolf<br>
          Hilferding out of the position of minister of finance by
          refusing bank<br>
          credit to the government until this was done.<br>
          <br>
          In March 1930, the Center broke the coalition on the issue of<br>
          &nbsp;(40 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          reduction of unemployment benefits, the Socialists were thrown
          out of<br>
          the government, and Heinrich Bruning, leader of the Center
          Party, came<br>
          in as chancellor. Because he did not have a majority, he had
          to put<br>
          the deflationary policy into effect by the use of presidential
          decree.<br>
          This marked the end of the Weimar Republic.<br>
          <br>
          The Socialists permitted Bruning to remain in office by
          refusing<br>
          to vote on a motion of no confidence. Left in office, Bruning<br>
          continued the deflationary policy by decrees.<br>
          <br>
          Page 431<br>
          <br>
          Bruning's policy of deflation was a disaster. The suffering of<br>
          the people was terrible with almost eight million unemployed
          out of<br>
          twenty-five million employable.<br>
          <br>
          Page 433<br>
          <br>
          President Hindenburg had no liking for any unorthodox economic<br>
          schemes.<br>
          <br>
          The Quartet, especially the industrialists, decided that
          Hitler<br>
          had learned a lesson and could safely be put into office as
          the<br>
          figurehead of a Right government because he was growing
          weaker. The<br>
          whole deal was arranged by Papen and was sealed in an
          agreement made<br>
          at the home of Cologne banker Baron Kurt Von Schroder in 1933.<br>
          <br>
          THE NAZI REGIME 1933-1934<br>
          <br>
          Adolf Hitler's life had been a succession of failures, the
          seven<br>
          years 1907-1914 being passed as a social derelict in Vienna
          and<br>
          Munich. There he had become a fanatical Pan-German
          anti-semite,<br>
          attributing his own failures to the "intrigues of
          international<br>
          Jewry."<br>
          <br>
          Page 434<br>
          <br>
          During the Great War, he was an excellent soldier always<br>
          volunteering for the most dangerous tasks. Although he was
          decorated<br>
          with the Iron Cross first class in 1918, he was never promoted
          beyond<br>
          Private First Class. His regiment of 3,500 suffered 3,260
          killed and<br>
          Hitler himself was wounded twice.<br>
          <br>
          After the war, he stayed with the army and eventually became a<br>
          political spy for the Reichswehr. In the course of spying on
          the<br>
          numerous political groups, Hitler became fascinated by the
          rantings of<br>
          Gottfried Feder against the "interest slavery of the Jews."<br>
          Hitler joined the National Socialist German Worker's Party
          which<br>
          drew up a Twenty-five Point Program.<br>
          <br>
          Page 435<br>
          <br>
          These included:<br>
          <br>
          4) all Jews and other aliens eliminated;<br>
          5) all unearned incomes to be abolished;<br>
          6) to punish all war profiteers and usurers with death.<br>
          <br>
          Page 446<br>
          <br>
          Prices were set at a level sufficient to give a profit to most<br>
          participants and quotas were based on assessments estimated by
          the<br>
          farmers themselves. The autarky program gave them a stable
          market for<br>
          the products, shielding them from the vicissitudes which they
          had<br>
          suffered under liberalism with its unstable markets and
          fluctuating<br>
          prices. The prices fixed under Nazism were not high but were
          adequate,<br>
          especially in combination with other advantages.<br>
          <br>
          Payments for interest and taxes were both reduced.<br>
          All farms of over family size were made secure in possession
          of<br>
          their owner's family, with no possibility of alienation, by
          increasing<br>
          the use of entail on great estates and by the Hereditary Farms
          Act for<br>
          lesser units.<br>

          A law of December 28, 1939 stated, what had always been<br>
          understood, that in his civil service work a party member was
          not<br>
          subject to party orders but only to the orders of the civil
          service<br>
          superior.<br>

          There was a statutory provision which made it illegal for
          members<br>
          of the armed services to be simultaneously members of the
          party.<br>

          Maximum wage rates were set in June 1938. In return for<br>
          exploitation of labor, the worker received certain
          compensations<br>
          of which the chief was the fact that he was no longer
          threatened with<br>
          the danger of mass unemployment. Increased economic activity
          went to<br>
          nonconsumers' goods.<br>

          It is the Government that controls the House of Commons. This<br>
          control is exercised through the Cabinet's control of the
          political<br>
          machinery. This power over the party machinery is exercised
          through<br>
          control of party funds and of nominations to constituencies.
          The fact<br>
          party candidates are named by an inner clique is of tremendous<br>
          importance and is the key to the control which the inner
          clique<br>
          exercises over the House of Commons, yet it is rarely
          mentioned in<br>
          books on the English political system. The party control is
          almost<br>
          completely centralized in the hands of a largely
          self-perpetuating<br>
          inner clique which has power of approval over all candidates.
          Cabinet<br>
          can force the majority by using party discipline to pass
          bills.<br>
          <br>
          Page 464<br>
          <br>
          Britain can be divided into two groups, the "classes" and the<br>
          "masses." The "classes" were the ones who had leisure. This
          meant that<br>
          they had property and income and did not need to work for a
          living;<br>
          they obtained an education in a separate and expensive system;
          they<br>
          married within their own class; they had a distinctive accent;
          and<br>
          they had a distinctive attitude based on the training provided
          in the<br>
          special educational system of the "classes."<br>
          <br>
          Page 465<br>
          <br>
          This educational system was based on three great negatives:<br>
          <br>
          a) education must not be vocational, not aimed at assisting
          one to<br>
          make a living;<br>
          b) education is not aimed directly at creating or training<br>
          intelligence;<br>
          c) education is not aimed at finding the "Truth."<br>
          It is aimed at developing a moral outlook, a respect for<br>
          traditions, qualities of leadership and cooperation, and that
          ability<br>
          for cooperation in competition summed up in the English idea
          of<br>
          "sport" and "playing the game." Because of the restricted
          numbers of<br>
          the upper class, these attitudes applied chiefly to one
          another, and<br>
          did not necessarily apply to foreigners or even to the masses.
          They<br>
          applied to people who "belonged" and not to all human beings.<br>
          <br>
          Page 469<br>
          <br>
          House members are expected to vote as their party whips tell
          them<br>
          to and are not expected to understand the contents of the
          bills for<br>
          which they are voting. Legislation originates in the meetings
          of the<br>
          clique of the party, acting as first chamber. If accepted by
          the<br>
          Cabinet, it passes the House of Commons almost automatically.
          This<br>
          situation is sometimes called "Cabinet dictatorship."<br>
          <br>

          There have been restrictions on democracy in Britain almost
          all<br>
          based on one criterion, the possession of wealth. Britain,
          until 1945,<br>
          was the world's greatest plutocracy.<br>
          In political life, local government had a restricted suffrage.<br>
          Elected members were unpaid thus restricting these posts to
          those who<br>
          &nbsp;(42 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          had leisure (that is, wealth).<br>
          <br>
          Page 471<br>
          <br>
          Members of Parliament were, for years, restricted to the
          well-todo<br>
          by the fact that Members were unpaid. In 1938, each candidate
          must<br>
          post a deposit of #150 amounting to more than the total annual
          income<br>
          of about three-quarters of all English families which is
          forfeited if<br>
          he does not receive over one-eighth of the total vote. As a
          result of<br>
          these monetary barriers, the overwhelming mass of Englishmen
          could not<br>
          participate actively in politics unless they could find an
          outside<br>
          source of funds.<br>
          <br>
          Until 1915, the two parties represented the same social class,<br>
          the small group known as "society." Both Conservatives and
          Liberals<br>
          were controlled by the same small clique consisting of no more
          than<br>
          half-a-dozen chief families, their relatives and allies.<br>
          <br>
          Page 472<br>
          <br>
          At the beginning of the 20th century, the inner clique of the<br>
          Conservative Party was made up almost completely of the Cecil
          family<br>
          and their relatives.<br>
          <br>
          This is quite different from the US where both major parties
          are<br>
          middle-class parties and where geographic, religious and
          traditional<br>
          influences are more important than class influences in
          determining<br>
          party membership.<br>

          In eight years (1931-1939) thirteen directors of the "Big Five<br>
          Banks" and two directors of the Bank of England were raised to
          the<br>
          peerage by the Conservative government. Of ninety peers
          created,<br>
          thirty five were directors of insurance companies. In 1935,
          Walter<br>
          Runciman, as president of the Board of Trade, introduced a
          bill to<br>
          grant a subsidy of #2 million to tramp merchant vessels and
          gave<br>
          #92,000 to his father's company in which he held 21,000
          shares. There<br>
          is relatively little objection to activities of this kind in
          England.<br>

          The Labour Party arose because of the discovery by the masses
          of<br>
          the people that their vote did not avail them much so long as
          the only<br>
          choice of candidates was "Which of two rich people will you
          choose?"<br>

          The radio, the second most important instrument of publicity,
          is<br>
          sometimes run very unfairly. In the election of 1931, the
          government<br>
          allowed 15 period on the BBC for political campaigning, it
          took 11,<br>
          gave 3 to Labour and 1 to the Liberals.<br>

          France is in sharp contrast where the amount of education by a<br>
          student is limited only by his ability and willingness to
          work; and<br>
          positions of importance in the civil service, the professions,
          and<br>
          even business are available to those who do best in the
          system. In<br>
          Britain, it is based largely on the ability to pay.<br>

          For admission to the bar in England, a man had to be a member
          of<br>
          one of the four Inns of Court. These are private clubs to
          which<br>
          admission was by nomination with large admission fees. Sons of
          wage<br>
          earners formed less than 1% of the admissions and members of
          the bar<br>
          are almost entirely from the well-to-do classes. Since judges
          are<br>
          appointed exclusively from barristers, the judicial system has
          also<br>
          been monopolized by the upper classes. Obtaining justice has
          been<br>
          complex, slow and above all, expensive. As a result, only the
          fairly<br>
          well-to-do can defend their rights in a civil suit and if the
          less<br>
          well-to-do go to court at all, they find themselves in an
          atmosphere<br>
          completely dominated by members of the upper classes.
          Accordingly, the<br>
          ordinary Englishman avoids litigation even when he has right
          on his<br>
          side.<br>

          The 1909 Liberal budget was aimed directly at Conservative<br>
          supporters by its taxation of unearned incomes, especially
          from landed<br>
          properties. Its rejection by the House of Lords was denounced
          by<br>
          Asquith as a breach of the constitution which gave control
          over money<br>
          bills to the House of Commons. The Lords refused to yield
          until<br>
          Asquith threatened to create enough new peers to carry his
          bill. This<br>
          bill provided that the Lords could not veto a money bill and
          could not<br>
          prevent any other bill from becoming law if it was passed in
          three<br>
          sessions of the Commons over a period of at least two years.<br>

          Liberal Lloyd George's effort to deflate prices after the
          Great<br>
          War in order to go back onto the gold standard was fatal to
          prosperity<br>
          and domestic order. Unemployment and strikes increased.<br>
          The Conservatives prevented any realistic attack on these<br>
          problems and passed the Emergency Power Act of 1920 which for
          the<br>
          first time gave a peace-time government the right to proclaim
          a state<br>
          of siege (as was done in 1920, 1921, 1926).<br>

          In 1924, Winston Churchill, as chancellor of the Exchequer,<br>
          carried out a stabilization policy which put England on the
          gold<br>
          standard. This policy of deflation drove Britain into an
          economic<br>
          depression and a period of labour conflict and the policy was
          so<br>
          bungled in its execution that Britain was doomed to
          semi-depressions<br>
          for almost a decade, to financial subjugation to France until
          1931 and<br>
          was driven closer to domestic rebellion than she had been at
          any time<br>
          since the Chartist movement of 1848.<br>
          <br>
          The deflation of 1926 hit the mines with special impact since<br>
          prices could only be cut if wages were cut. The government
          invoked the<br>
          Emergency Powers Act and the Trade Unions Congress ordered a
          General<br>
          Strike but soon ended it leaving the striking miners to shift
          for<br>
          themselves. The miners stayed out for six months and then
          began to<br>
          drift back to work to escape starvation.<br>

          In 1931, the Macmillan Committee reported that the whole<br>
          financial structure was unsound and should be remedied by a
          managed<br>
          currency, controlled by the Bank of England. The crisis
          revealed the<br>
          incapacity of the Labour Party and the power of the bankers.
          Labour<br>
          members had no understanding of economics. Snowden, the
          economic<br>
          expert" of the Cabinet, had financial views about the same as
          Montagu<br>
          Norman of the Bank of England.<br>
          <br>
          Page 490<br>
          <br>
          As for the bankers, they were in control throughout the
          crisis.<br>
          While publicly they insisted on a balanced budget, privately,
          they<br>
          refused to accept balancing by taxation and insisted on
          balancing by<br>
          cuts in relief payments. Working in close cooperation with
          American<br>
          bankers, they were in a position to overthrow any government
          which was<br>
          not willing to crush them completely. While they refused
          cooperation<br>
          to the Labour government, they were able to obtain a loan of
          #80<br>
          million from the US and France for the National Government
          when it<br>
          was only four days old.<br>
          <br>
          The National government at once attacked the financial crisis<br>
          with a typical bankers' weapon: deflation. It offered a budget<br>
          including higher taxes and drastic cuts in unemployment
          benefits and<br>
          public salaries. Riots, protests, and mutiny in the navy were
          the<br>
          results.<br>
          <br>
          The domestic program of the National Government was to curtail<br>
          the personal freedom of individuals. On this, there was no
          real<br>
          protest for the Labour opposition had a program which, in fact
          if not<br>
          in theory, tended in the same direction.<br>

          The police of London were reorganized in 1933 to destroy their<br>
          obvious sympathy with the working classes by restricting all
          ranks<br>
          above inspector to persons with an upper-class education.<br>
          A severe Incitement to Disaffection Act in 1934 threatened to<br>
          destroy the personal freedoms built up over centuries by
          making<br>
          police searches of homes less restricted and making the simple<br>
          possession of material likely to disaffect the armed forces a
          crime.<br>
          For the first time in three generations, personal freedom and
          civil<br>
          rights were restricted in time of peace. The Prevention of
          Violence<br>
          Act of 1939 empowered a secretary of state to arrest without
          warrant<br>
          and to deport without trial.<br>

          Neville Chamberlain was chiefly responsible for the National<br>
          government's fiscal policies. For the first time in almost a
          century,<br>
          there was an increase in the proportion of total tax paid by
          the<br>
          working class. For the first time since 1846, there was a tax
          on food.<br>
          There was a reversal in the trend to more education for the
          people.<br>
          The budget was kept balanced by at a considerable price in
          human<br>
          suffering and in wastage of Britain's irreplaceable human
          resources.<br>
          Hundreds of thousands had been unemployed for years and had
          their<br>
          moral fiber completely destroyed by years of living on
          inadequate<br>
          dole. The capitalists of these areas were supported either by<br>
          government subsidy or were bought out by cartels and trade<br>
          associations from funds assessed on the more active members of
          the<br>
          industry.<br>
          <br>
          Chamberlain's Derating Act of 1929 exempted industry from
          payment<br>
          of three quarters of its taxes while many unemployed were
          allowed to<br>
          starve.<br>

          CHAPTER XI: CHANGING ECONOMIC PATTERNS<br>
          <br>
          Page 497<br>
          <br>
          The economic system itself has become organized for expansion
          and<br>
          if it does not expand, it tends to collapse. The basic reason
          for this<br>
          maladjustment is that investment has become an essential part
          of the<br>
          system and if investment falls off, consumers have
          insufficient<br>
          incomes to buy the consumers' goods which are being produced
          in<br>
          another part of the system because part of the flow of
          purchasing<br>
          power created by the production of goods was diverted from
          purchasing<br>
          goods it had produced into savings, and all the goods produced
          could<br>
          not be sold until those savings came back into the market by
          being<br>
          invested.<br>
          <br>
          Page 498<br>
          <br>
          If the groups in society who control the savings which are<br>
          necessary for progress are the same vested interests who
          benefit by<br>
          the existing way of doing things, they are in a position to
          defend<br>
          these vested interests and prevent progress merely by
          preventing the<br>
          use of surpluses to finance new inventions. The 20th century's<br>
          economic crisis was a situation of this type.<br>

          <br>
          The element of secrecy is one of the outstanding features of<br>
          English business and financial life. The inner circle of
          English<br>
          financial life remains a matter of "whom one knows," rather
          than "what<br>
          one knows." Jobs are still obtained by family, marriage, or
          school<br>
          connections and important positions are given to men who have
          no<br>
          training, experience or knowledge to qualify them.<br>
          <br>
          Page 500<br>
          <br>
          At the core of English financial life have been seventeen
          private<br>
          firms of "merchant bankers" with a total of less than a
          hundred active<br>
          partners including Baring Brothers, N.M. Rothschild, J. Henry<br>
          &nbsp;(45 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          Schroder, Morgan Grenfell, Hambros and Lazard Brothers. These
          merchant<br>
          bankers had a dominant position with the Bank of England and,<br>
          strangely enough, still have retained some of this, despite
          the<br>
          nationalization of the Bank by the Labour government in 1946.<br>
          <br>
          Page 501<br>
          <br>
          Financial capitalism was marked not only by a growing
          financial<br>
          control of industry but also by an increasing concentration of
          this<br>
          control and by an increasing banking control of government.<br>
          The control of the Bank of England over business was exercised<br>
          indirectly through the joint-stock banks. This growth of a
          "money<br>
          trust" led to an investigation. A bill was drawn up to prevent
          further<br>
          concentration but was withdrawn when the bankers made a
          "gentlemen's<br>
          agreement" to ask Treasury permission for future
          amalgamations.<br>
          <br>
          Page 502<br>
          <br>
          In 1931, financiers led by Montagu Norman and J.P. Morgan
          forced<br>
          the resignation of the British Labour government. But the
          handwriting<br>
          was already on the wall. The deflationary financial policy of
          the<br>
          bankers had alienated politicians and industrialists and
          driven<br>
          monopolist trade unions to form a united front against the
          bankers.<br>
          Labour and industry were united in opposition to continuance
          to the<br>
          bankers' economic policy with its low prices and high
          unemployment.<br>
          The decisive factor which caused the end of financial
          capitalism in<br>
          Britain was the revolt of the British fleet in 1931 and not
          the<br>
          abandonment of gold six days later. The mutiny made it clear
          that the<br>
          policy of deflations must be ended. As a result, no effort was
          made to<br>
          defend the gold standard.<br>
          <br>
          Page 503<br>
          <br>
          The Coal Mines Act of 1930 allowed the National Shipbuilders<br>
          Security to buy up and destroy shipyards. By 1934, one quarter
          of<br>
          Britain's shipbuilding capacity had been eliminated. The
          Purchase<br>
          Finance Company was set up to buy up and destroy flour mills.
          By 1933,<br>
          over one-sixth of the flour mills in England had been
          eliminated.<br>

          Page 507<br>
          <br>
          In Germany, capital was scarce when industrialism arrived and<br>
          industry found itself dependent upon banks almost at once. The
          chief<br>
          credit banks floated securities for industry by granting
          credit to the<br>
          firm, taking securities in return. These securities were
          slowly sold<br>
          to the public with the bank retaining enough stock to give it
          control<br>
          and appointing its men as directors to give that control final
          form.<br>
          The importance of interlocking directorships can be seen from
          the<br>
          fact that the same Dresdner Bank had its directors on the
          boards of<br>
          over two hundred industrial concerns in 1913.<br>
          <br>
          This banking control of industry was made even closer since
          most<br>
          investors left their securities on deposit with the banks
          which voted<br>
          all this stock for directorships and other control measures,
          unless<br>
          the stock-owners expressly forbade it. The banks also voted
          the stock<br>
          left as collateral for loans and all stock bought on margin.<br>
          <br>
          Page 509<br>
          <br>
          The control of German financial capitalism rested in the
          credit<br>
          banks. It was largely beyond the control of the government and
          rested<br>
          in private hands. Of the hundreds of German credit banks, the
          eight<br>
          so-called "Great Banks" were the masters of the German economy
          from<br>
          1865 to 1915 and controlled 74% of the capital assets of all
          421<br>
          banks.<br>
          <br>

          I.G. Farbenindustrie made many individual cartel agreements

          In France, Britain and the US, the war played a significant
          role<br>
          in demonstrating conclusively that economic stagnation and<br>
          &nbsp;(46 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          underemployment of resources were not necessary and could be
          avoided<br>
          if the financial system were subordinated to the economic
          system. In<br>
          Germany, this was not necessary since the Nazis had already
          made this<br>
          discovery in the 1930s.<br>
          <br>
          Thus a surplus of labor, low wages, experience in unorthodox<br>
          financial operations and an immense task to be done all
          contributed to<br>
          the German revival.<br>

          <br>
          Page 515<br>
          <br>
          With the founding of the Bank of France in 1800, financial
          power<br>
          was in the hands of about ten or fifteen banking houses whose<br>
          founders, in most cases, had come from Switzerland. These
          bankers, all<br>
          Protestant, were deeply involved in the agitations leading up
          to the<br>
          French Revolution. When it got out of the hand, they were the
          chief<br>
          forces behind the rise of Napoleon. As a reward for this
          support,<br>
          Napoleon gave these bankers a monopoly over French financial
          life by<br>
          giving them control of the new Bank of France.<br>
          <br>
          Page 516<br>
          <br>
          By 1811, most of these bankers had gone over to the opposition<br>
          and survived the change in regime in 1815. As a result, the
          Protestant<br>
          bankers who had controlled financial life under the First
          Empire were<br>
          still the main figures on the board of regents of the Bank of
          France<br>
          until 1936. The chief names were Mirabaud, Mallet, Neuflize,
          and<br>
          Hottinger.<br>
          <br>
          In the course of the nineteenth century, a second group was
          added<br>
          to French banking circles. This second group, largely Jewish,
          was also<br>
          non-French origin, the majority Germanic (like Rothschild,
          Heine,<br>
          Fould, Stern and Worms). A rivalry soon grew up between the
          older<br>
          Protestant bankers and the newer Jewish bankers, largely along<br>
          political rather than religious lines which grew confused as
          some of<br>
          the Jewish group gave up their religion and moved over to the<br>
          Protestant group.<br>
          <br>
          The leadership of the Protestant group was exercised by
          Mirabaud,<br>
          the leadership of the Jewish group was held by Rothschild.
          These two<br>
          wings were so close that Mirabaud and Rothschild together
          dominated<br>
          the whole financial system and frequently cooperated together
          even<br>
          when their groups as a whole were in competition.<br>
          <br>
          After 1838, this simple picture was complicated by the slow
          rise<br>
          of a third group of bankers who were Catholics which soon
          split into<br>
          two halves and joined the other two groups.<br>

          The rivalry of these two great powers fills the pages of
          French<br>
          history in the period 1884-1940. It paralyzed the French
          political<br>
          system and economic system preventing economic recovery from
          the<br>
          depression in 1935-1940.<br>
          <br>
          From 1880-1925, the private bankers continued to exist and
          grow<br>
          in power. They were at first chiefly interested in government<br>
          obligations and the greatest bankers, like Mirabaud and
          Rothschild,<br>
          had intimate connections with governments and weak connections
          with<br>
          the economic life of the country.<br>

          To finance railroads, the small savings of many were gathered
          and<br>
          made available to the private banker to direct wherever he
          thought<br>
          fitting. Thus the private banker became a manager of other
          persons'<br>
          funds rather than lender of his own. The private banker became
          much<br>
          more influential and much less noticeable. He now controlled
          billions<br>
          where he formerly controlled millions and he did it
          unobtrusively,<br>
          acting from the background, concealed from public view. The
          public did<br>
          not notice that the names of private bankers and their agents
          still<br>
          graced the list of directors of new financial enterprises.<br>

          The centre of the French economic system in the 20th century
          was<br>
          not to be found, as some have believed, in the Bank of France,
          but,<br>
          instead, resided in a group of almost unknown institutions -
          the<br>
          private banks. There were over a hundred of these private
          banks and<br>
          two (Rothschild and Mirabaud) were more powerful than all the
          others<br>
          combined. These private banks acted as the High Command of the
          French<br>
          economic system. Their stock was closely held in the hands of
          about<br>
          forty families. They were the same private banks which had set
          up the<br>
          Bank of France divided into a group of seven Jewish banks, a
          group of<br>
          seven Protestant banks and a group of five Catholic banks. The
          various<br>
          groups continued to cooperate in the management of the Bank of
          France<br>
          which was controlled until 1936, as it had been in 1813, by
          the<br>
          handful of private banks which created it.<br>
          <br>
          Page 521<br>
          <br>
          The state was influenced by the Treasury's need for funds from<br>
          the Bank of France.<br>
          <br>
          These investment banks supplied long-term capital to industry
          and<br>
          took stock and directorships in return. In 1931, Paribas held<br>
          the securities of 357 corporations and its own directors and
          top<br>
          managers held 180 directorships in 120 of the more important
          of these.<br>
          <br>
          Page 522<br>
          <br>
          The Jewish bankers were allied to Standard Oil and Rockefeller<br>
          while the Catholic-Protestant bankers were allied to Royal
          Dutch Shell<br>
          and Deterding.<br>
          <br>
          Page 524<br>

          In 1936, there were about 800 important firms. Of these 800,
          the<br>
          Paribas bloc controlled almost 400 and the Union-Comite bloc
          about<br>
          300.<br>
          <br>
          Page 525<br>
          The whole Paribas system in the 20th century was headed by
          Baron<br>
          Edouard de Rothschild with the chief center of operation in
          the Banque<br>
          de Paris which controlled communications companies such as
          Havas.<br>
          Havas was a great monopolistic news agency. It could, and did,<br>
          suppress or spread both news and advertising. It received
          secret<br>
          subsidies from the government for almost a century. The
          monopoly on<br>
          distribution of periodicals and books could be used to kill
          papers<br>
          which were regarded as objectionable.<br>
          <br>
          After 1937, the Paribas bloc was badly split by the
          controversy<br>
          over orthodox and unorthodox financial methods for dealing
          with<br>
          depression. The Rothschild desire to form an alliance with
          Russia and<br>
          adopt a policy of resistance to Hitler, continuing orthodox
          financial<br>
          policies, collapsed from its own internal contradictions,
          their own<br>
          lack of faith in it, and the pressure of Great Britain.<br>

          The three prewar blocs have played no significant role in
          France<br>
          since 1945 although Rene Mayer, active head of the Rothschild
          family<br>
          interests was minister of finance in the early postwar
          government.<br>
          Later in 1962, De Gaulle made the director of the Rothschild
          bank,<br>

          By the 1880s, the techniques of financial capitalism reached<br>
          levels of corruption which were never approached in Europe.
          This<br>
          corruption sought to cheat the ordinary investor by flotations
          and<br>
          manipulations of securities for the benefit of insiders. The<br>
          practitioners of these dishonesties were as socially
          acceptable as<br>
          their wealth entitled them to be without animadversions on how
          that<br>
          wealth was obtained.<br>

          <br>
          Corrupt techniques associated with the names Daniel Drew and
          Jay<br>
          Gould were also practiced by Morgan and others who became
          respectable<br>
          from longer sustained success.<br>
          <br>
          Any reform of Wall Street practices came from pressure from
          the<br>
          farming West and was long delayed by the close alliance of
          Wall Street<br>
          with the two major political parties. By 1900, the influence
          of Morgan<br>
          in the Republican party was dominant, his chief rivalry coming
          from<br>
          Rockefeller of Ohio.<br>
          <br>
          From 1880 to 1930, financial capitalism approximated a feudal<br>
          structure in which two great powers, centered in New York,
          dominated a<br>
          number of lesser powers. No description of this structure as
          it<br>
          existed in the 1920s can be given in a brief compass, since it<br>
          infiltrated all aspects of American life and especially all
          branches<br>
          of economic life.<br>
          <br>
          At the center were a group of less than dozen investment banks<br>
          which were still unincorporated partnerships at the height of
          their<br>
          powers. These included J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller family,
          Kuhn,<br>
          Loeb, Dillon, Read, Brown Brothers and Harriman, and others.
          Each of<br>
          these was linked in organizational or personal relationships
          with<br>
          various banks, insurance companies, railroads, utilities and<br>
          industrial firms. The result was to form a number of webs of
          economic<br>
          power.<br>
          <br>
          J.P. Morgan worked in close relationship with a group of banks<br>
          and insurance companies. The whole nexus dominated a network
          of<br>
          business firms which included at least one-sixth of the two
          hundred<br>
          largest non-financial corporations.<br>
          <br>
          Page 531<br>
          <br>
          The Rockefeller group, investing only its own profits,
          functioned<br>
          as a capitalist unit in close cooperation with Morgan and
          controlled<br>
          over half the assets of the oil industry.<br>
          <br>
          Page 532<br>
          <br>
          The economic power represented by these figures is almost
          beyond<br>
          imagination to grasp. Morgan and Rockefeller together
          frequently<br>
          dominated the national Republican Party while Morgan
          occasionally had<br>
          extensive influence in the national Democratic Party. These
          two were<br>
          also powerful on the state level, especially Morgan in New
          York<br>
          and Rockefeller in Ohio. Mellon was a power in Pennsylvania
          and Du<br>
          Pont in Delaware.<br>
          <br>
          In the 1920s, this system of economic and political power
          formed<br>
          a hierarchy headed by the Morgan interests and played a
          principal role<br>
          both in political and business life. Morgan, operating on the<br>
          international level in cooperation with his allies abroad,
          especially<br>
          in England, influenced the events of history to a degree which
          cannot<br>
          be specified in detail but which certainly was tremendous. The<br>
          deflationary financial policies on which these bankers
          insisted were<br>
          laying the foundations of the economic collapse into general
          social<br>
          disaster by 1940. Unemployment which had reached 13 million
          persons in<br>
          1933 was still at 10 million in 1940<br>
          <br>
          Page 533<br>
          <br>
          The deflationary policies of the bankers were acceptable to
          heavy<br>
          industry chiefly because it was not unionized. With
          assembly-line<br>
          techniques financed by the bankers and unorganized labor, the<br>
          employers could rearrange, curtail, or terminate labor without
          notice<br>
          on a daily basis and could thus reduce labor costs to meet
          falls in<br>
          prices from bankers' deflation.<br>
          <br>
          The fact that reductions in wages and large lay-offs also
          reduced<br>
          the volume of purchasing power as a whole, to the injury of
          the groups<br>
          selling consumers' goods, was ignored by the makers of heavy<br>
          producers' goods. In this way, farmers and other segments of
          the<br>
          society were injured by the deflationary policies of the
          bankers and<br>
          &nbsp;(49 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          by the employment policies of heavy industry, closely allied
          to the<br>
          bankers.<br>
          <br>
          When these policies became unbearable in the depression of
          1929-<br>
          1933, these other interest blocs deserted the Republican party
          which<br>
          remained subservient to high finance and heavy industry. The
          shift of<br>
          the farm bloc to the Democratic Party in 1932 resulted in the
          election<br>
          of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.<br>
          <br>
          Page 534<br>
          <br>
          The New Deal's actions against finance did not represent any<br>
          victory for unorthodox financing, the real key to either
          monopoly<br>
          capitalism or to a managed pluralist society. The reason for
          this was<br>
          that the New Deal was fundamentally orthodox in its ideas on
          the<br>
          nature of money. Roosevelt was quite willing to unbalance the
          budget<br>
          and to spend in a depression in an unorthodox fashion because
          he had<br>
          grasped the idea that lack of purchasing power was the cause
          of the<br>
          lack of demand which made unsold goods and unemployment, but
          he had no<br>
          idea of the causes of the depression and had quite orthodox
          ideas on<br>
          the nature of money. As a result, his administration treated
          the<br>
          symptoms rather than the causes of the depression and, while
          spending<br>
          unorthodoxly to treat these symptoms, did so with money
          borrowed from<br>
          the banks in the accepted fashion. The New Deal allowed
          bankers to<br>
          create the money, borrowed it from the banks,and spent it.
          This meant<br>
          that the New Deal ran up the national debt to the credit of
          the banks,<br>
          and spent money in such a limited fashion that no drastic
          reemployment<br>
          of idle resources was possible.<br>
          <br>
          One of the most significant facts about the New Deal was its<br>
          orthodoxy on money. For the whole 12 years he was in the White
          House,<br>
          Roosevelt had statutory power to issue fiat money in the form
          of<br>
          greenbacks printed by the government without recourse to the
          banks.<br>
          This authority was never used. As a result of such orthodoxy,
          the<br>
          depression's symptoms of idle resources were overcome only
          when the<br>
          emergency of the war in 1942 made it possible to justify a
          limitless<br>
          increase in the national debt by limitless borrowing from
          private<br>
          persons and the banks. But the whole episode showed a failure
          to grasp<br>
          the nature of money and the function of the monetary system,
          of which<br>
          considerable traces remained in the postwar period.<br>
          <br>
          Page 535<br>
          <br>
          One reason for the New Deal's readiness to continue with an<br>
          orthodox theory of the nature of money, along with an
          unorthodox<br>
          practice in its use, arose from the failure of the Roosevelt<br>
          administration to recognize the nature of the economic crisis
          itself.<br>
          This failure can be seen in Roosevelt's theory of "pump
          priming." He<br>
          sincerely believed, as did his Secretary of the Treasury, that
          there<br>
          was nothing structurally wrong with the economy, that it was<br>
          temporarily stalled, and would keep going of its own powers if
          it<br>
          could be restarted...<br>
          <br>
          The inadequacy of this theory of the depression was shown in
          1937<br>
          when the New Deal, after four years of pump priming and a
          victorious<br>
          election in 1936, stopped its spending. Instead of taking off,
          the<br>
          economy collapsed in the steepest recession in history. The
          New Deal<br>
          had to resume its treatment of symptoms but now without hope
          that the<br>
          spending program could ever be ended, a hopeless prospect
          since the<br>
          administration lacked the knowledge of how to reform the
          system or<br>
          even how to escape from borrowing bank credit with its
          mounting public<br>
          debt, and the administration lacked the courage to adopt the
          really<br>
          large-scale spending necessary to give full employment of
          resources.<br>
          The administration was saved from this impasse by the need for
          the<br>
          rearmament program followed by the war. Since 1947 the Cold
          War and<br>
          the space program have allowed the same situation to continue,
          so that<br>
          even today, prosperity is not the result of a properly
          organized<br>
          economic system but of government spending, and any drastic
          reduction<br>
          &nbsp;(50 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          in such spending would give rise to an acute depression.<br>

          THE ECONOMIC FACTORS<br>
          <br>
          Page 540<br>
          <br>
          There are a number of important elements in the economic<br>
          situation of the 20th century.<br>
          8. The increasing disparity in the distribution of income is
          the<br>
          most controversial and least well-established characteristic
          of the<br>
          system. It would appear that the disparity in national income
          has been<br>
          getting wider.<br>
          <br>
          In the US, the richest one-fifth receive 46% of the income in<br>
          1910, 51% in 1929 and 48% in 1937. In the same three years,
          the share<br>
          of the poorest one-fifth fell from 8% to 5.4% to 3.6%<br>
          If instead of one-fifth, we examine the richest and poorest
          onetenth,<br>
          in 1910 the ratio was 10, in 1929 it was 21.7, in 1937, it was<br>
          34.4. This means that the rich were getting richer relatively
          and<br>
          probably absolutely while the poor were getting poorer both
          relatively<br>
          and absolutely.<br>

          The progressives who insisted that the lack of investment was<br>
          caused by lack of consumer purchasing power were correct. But
          the<br>
          conservatives who insisted that the lack of investment was
          caused by<br>
          lack of confidence were also correct. Each was looking at the
          opposite<br>
          side of a single continuous cycle:<br>
          <br>
          a) purchasing power creates demand for goods;<br>
          b) demand for goods creates confidence in the minds of
          investors;<br>
          c) confidence creates new investment;<br>
          d) new investment creates purchasing power which then creates
          demand.<br>
          It would appear that the economic factors alone affected the<br>
          distribution of incomes in the direction of increasing
          disparity.<br>

          In Germany, Hitler's 1934 adoption of an unorthodox financial<br>
          policy which raised the standards of living of the
          lower-income levels<br>
          even more drastically (by shifting them from unemployment with
          incomes<br>
          close to nothing into wage-earning positions in industry) was
          not<br>
          acceptable to the high-income classes because it stopped the
          threat of<br>
          revolution by the discontented masses and because it was
          obviously of<br>
          long-run benefit to them. This long-run benefit began to
          appear when<br>
          capacity employment of capital and labor was achieved in 1937.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          In the modern economic community, the sum total of goods and<br>
          services appearing in the market is at one and the same time
          the<br>
          income of the community and the aggregate cost of producing
          goods and<br>
          services in question. Aggregate costs, aggregate incomes and
          aggregate<br>
          prices are the same since they are merely opposite sides of
          the<br>
          identical expenditures.<br>
          <br>
          The purchasing power available in the community is equal to<br>
          income minus savings. If there are any savings, the available<br>
          purchasing power will be less than the aggregate prices being
          asked<br>
          for the products for sale and the amount of the savings. Thus,
          all the<br>
          goods and services produced cannot be sold as long as savings
          are held<br>
          back. In order for al the goods to be sold, it is necessary
          for the<br>
          savings to reappear in the market as purchasing power. The<br>
          disequilibrium between purchasing power and prices which are
          created<br>
          by the act of saving is restored completely by the act of
          investment,<br>
          and all the goods can be sold at the prices asked. But
          whenever<br>
          investment is less than savings, the available supply of
          purchasing<br>
          power is inadequate by the same amount to by the goods being
          offered.<br>
          This margin by which purchasing power is inadequate because of
          an<br>
          excess of savings over investment may be called the
          "deflationary<br>
          gap."This "deflationary gap" is the key to the twentieth
          century<br>

          THE RESULTS OF THE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION<br>
          <br>
          Page 547<br>
          <br>
          The deflationary gap arising from a failure of investment to<br>
          reach the level of savings can be closed either by lowering
          the supply<br>
          of goods to the level of available purchasing power or by
          raising the<br>
          supply of purchasing power to a level able to absorb the
          existing<br>
          supply of goods, or a combination of both. The first solution
          will<br>
          give a stabilized economy on a low level of activity; the
          second will<br>
          give a stabilized economy on a high level of activity. Left to
          itself,<br>
          the economic system under modern conditions would adopt the
          former<br>
          procedure working as follows: The deflationary gap will result
          in<br>
          falling prices, declining economic activity and rising
          unemployment.<br>
          This will result in a fall in national income resulting in an
          even<br>
          more rapid decline in the volume of savings. This decline
          continues<br>
          until the volume of savings reaches the level of investment at
          which<br>
          point the fall is arrested and the economy becomes stabilized
          at a low<br>
          level.<br>
          <br>
          This process did not work itself out in any industrial country<br>
          during the great depression because the disparity in national
          income<br>
          was so great that a considerable portion of the population
          would have<br>
          been driven to zero incomes and absolute want before savings
          of the<br>
          richer segment fell to the level of investment. Under such
          conditions,<br>
          the masses of population would have been driven to revolution
          and the<br>
          stabilization, if reached, would have been on a level so low
          that a<br>
          considerable portion of the population would have been in
          absolute<br>
          want. Because of this, governments took steps to arrest the
          course of<br>
          the depression before their citizens were driven to
          desperation.<br>
          The methods used to deal with the depression and close the<br>
          deflationary gap were all reducible to two fundamental types:<br>
          <br>
          a) those which destroy goods, and<br>
          b) those which produce goods which do not enter the market.<br>
          <br>
          The destruction of goods will close the deflationary gap by<br>
          reducing the supply of unsold goods through lowering the
          supply of<br>
          goods to the level of the supply of purchasing power. It is
          not<br>
          generally realized that this method is one of the chief ways
          in which<br>
          the gap is closed in a normal business cycle where goods are
          destroyed<br>
          by the simple expedient of not producing the goods which the
          system is<br>
          capable of producing. The failure to use full level of 1929
          output<br>
          represented a loss of $100 billion in the US, Britain and
          Germany<br>
          alone. This loss was equivalent to the destruction of such
          goods.<br>
          Destruction of goods by failure to gather the harvest is a
          common<br>
          phenomenon under modern conditions. When a farmer leaves his
          crop<br>
          unharvested because the price is too low to cover the expense
          of<br>
          harvesting, he is destroying the goods. Outright destruction
          of goods<br>
          already produced is not common and occurred for the first time
          as a<br>
          method of combating depression in the years 1930-1934. During
          this<br>
          period, stores of coffee, sugar, and bananas were destroyed,
          corn was<br>
          plowed under, and young livestock was slaughtered to reduce
          the supply<br>
          on the market. The destruction of goods in warfare is another
          example<br>
          of this method of overcoming deflationary conditions in the
          economic<br>
          system.<br>
          <br>
          Page 548<br>
          <br>
          The second method of filling the deflationary gap, namely, by<br>
          producing goods which do not enter the market, accomplishes
          its<br>
          purpose by providing purchasing power in the market, since the
          costs<br>
          of production of such goods do enter the market as purchasing
          power,<br>
          while the goods themselves do not drain funds from the system
          if they<br>
          are not offered for sale. New investment was the usual way in
          which<br>
          this was accomplished in the normal business cycle but it is
          not the<br>
          &nbsp;(52 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          normal way of filling the gap under modern conditions of
          depression.<br>
          We have already seen the growing reluctance to invest and the
          unlikely<br>
          chance that the purchasing power necessary for prosperity will
          be<br>
          provided by a constant stream of private investment. It this
          is so,<br>
          the funds for producing goods which do not enter the market
          must be<br>
          sought in a program of public spending.<br>
          <br>
          Any program of public spending at once runs into the problems
          of<br>
          inflation and public debt. These are the same two problems
          mentioned<br>
          in connection with the efforts of government to pay for the
          First<br>
          World War. The methods of paying for a depression are exactly
          the same<br>
          as the methods of paying for a war, except that the
          combination of<br>
          methods used may be somewhat different because the goals are
          somewhat<br>
          different. In financing a war, we should seek to achieve a
          method<br>
          which will provide a maximum of output with a minimum of
          inflation and<br>
          public debt. In dealing with a depression, since a chief aim
          is to<br>
          close the deflationary gap, the goal will be to provide a
          maximum of<br>
          output with a necessary degree of inflation and a minimum of
          public<br>
          debt. Thus the use of fiat money is more justifiable in
          financing a<br>
          depression than in financing a war. Moreover the selling of
          bonds to<br>
          private persons in wartime might well be aimed at the
          lower-income<br>
          groups in order to reduce consumption and release facilities
          for war<br>
          production, while in a depression (where low consumption is
          the chief<br>
          problem) such sales of bonds to finance public spending would
          have to<br>
          be aimed at the savings of the upper-income groups.<br>
          <br>
          These ideas on the role of government spending in combating<br>
          depression have been formally organized into the "theory of
          the<br>
          compensatory economy." This theory advocates that government
          spending<br>
          and fiscal policies be organized so that they work exactly
          contrary to<br>
          the business cycle, with lower taxes and larger spending in<br>
          deflationary period and higher taxes with reduced spending in
          a boom<br>
          period, the fiscal deficits of the down cycle being
          counterbalanced in<br>
          the national budget by the surpluses of the up cycle.<br>
          <br>
          Page 549<br>
          <br>
          This compensatory economy has not been applied with much
          success<br>
          in any European country except Sweden. In a democratic
          country, it<br>
          would take the control of taxing and spending away from the
          elected<br>
          representatives of the people and place this precious "power
          of the<br>
          purse" at the control of the automatic processes of the
          business cycle<br>
          as interpreted by bureaucratic (and representative) experts.
          Moreover,<br>
          all these programs of deficit spending are in jeopardy in a
          country<br>
          with a private banking system. In such a system, the creation
          of money<br>
          (or credit) is usually reserved for the private banking
          institutions<br>
          and is deprecated as a government action. The argument that
          the<br>
          creation of finds by the government is bad while creation of
          funds by<br>
          the banks is salutary is very persuasive in a system based on<br>
          traditional laissez faire and in which the usual avenues of<br>
          communications (such as newspapers and radio) are under
          private, or<br>
          even banker, control.<br>
          <br>
          Public spending as a method of counteracting depression can
          vary<br>
          very greatly in character, depending on the purposes of the
          spending.<br>
          Spending for destruction of goods or for restriction of
          output, as<br>
          under the New Deal agricultural program, cannot be justified
          easily<br>
          in a democratic country with freedom of communications because
          it<br>
          obviously results in a decline in national income and living<br>
          standards.<br>
          <br>
          Spending for non-productive monuments is somewhat easier to<br>
          justify but is hardly a long-run solution.<br>
          <br>
          Spending for investment in productive equipment (like the<br>
          Tennessee Valley Authority Dam) is obviously the best solution
          since<br>
          it leads to an increase in national wealth and standards of
          living and<br>
          &nbsp;(53 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          is a long-run solution but it marks a permanent departure from
          a<br>
          system of private capitalism and can be easily attacked in a
          country<br>
          with a capitalistic ideology and a private banking system.<br>
          Spending on armaments and national defence is the last method
          of<br>
          fighting depression and is the one most readily and most
          widely<br>
          adopted in the twentieth century.<br>
          <br>
          A program of public expenditure on armaments is a method for<br>
          filling the deflationary gap and overcoming depression because
          it adds<br>
          purchasing power to the market without drawing it out again
          later<br>
          (since the armaments, once produced, are not put up for sale).
          From an<br>
          economic point of view, this method of combating depression is
          not<br>
          much different from the method listed earlier under
          destruction of<br>
          goods, for, in this case also, economic resources are diverted
          from<br>
          constructive activities or idleness to production for
          destruction. The<br>
          appeal of this method for coping with the problem of
          depression does<br>
          not rest on economic grounds at all, for, on such grounds,
          there is<br>
          no justification. It's appeal is rather to be found on other,<br>
          especially political, grounds.<br>
          <br>
          Page 550<br>
          <br>
          The adoption of rearmament as a method of combating depression<br>
          does not have to be conscious. The country which adopts it may<br>
          honestly feel that it is adopting the policy for good reasons,
          that it<br>
          is threatened by aggression, and that a program of re-armament
          is<br>
          necessary for political protection. It is very rare for a
          country<br>
          consciously to adopt a program of aggression, for, in most
          wars, both<br>
          sides are convinced that their actions are defensive. It is
          almost<br>
          equally rare for a country to adopt a policy of re-armament as
          a<br>
          solution for depression. If a country adopts re-armament
          because of<br>
          fear of another's arms and these last are the result of
          efforts to<br>
          fill a deflationary gap, it can also be said that the
          re-armament of<br>
          the former has a basic economic cause.<br>
          <br>
          In the 20th century, the vested interests usually sought to<br>
          prevent the reform of the economic system (a reform whose need
          was<br>
          made evident by the long-drawn-out depression) by adopting an
          economic<br>
          program whose chief element was the effort to fill the
          deflationary<br>
          gap by re-armament.<br>
          <br>
          THE PLURALIST ECONOMY AND WORLD BLOCS<br>
          <br>
          The economic disasters of two wars, a world depression, and
          the<br>
          post-war fluctuations showed clearly by 1960 that a new
          economic<br>
          organization of society was both needed and available. The
          laissezfaire<br>
          competitive system had destroyed itself and almost destroyed<br>
          civilization as well by its inability to distribute the goods
          it could<br>
          produce. The system of monopoly capitalism had helped in this<br>
          disaster.<br>
          <br>
          Page 551<br>
          <br>
          The almost simultaneous failure of laissez-faire, Fascism, and
          of<br>
          Communism to satisfy the growing popular demand both for
          rising<br>
          standards of living and for spiritual liberty had forced the
          mid-20th<br>
          century to seek some new economic organization.<br>
          <br>
          Underdeveloped peoples have been struck by the conflicting
          claims<br>
          of the two great super-Powers.. The former offered the goods
          the new<br>
          peoples wanted (rising standards of living and freedom) while
          the<br>
          latter seemed to offer methods of getting these goods (by
          state<br>
          accumulation of capital, government direction of resources)
          which<br>
          might tend to smother these goals. The net result has been a<br>
          convergence toward a common, if remote, system of the future
          whose<br>
          ultimate nature is not yet clear but which we might call the<br>
          "pluralist economy."<br>

          The structure of collective security was destroyed completely<br>
          under the assaults of Japan, Italy and Germany who were
          attacking the<br>
          whole nineteenth century way of life and some of the most
          fundamental<br>
          attributes of Western Civilization itself. They were in revolt
          against<br>
          democracy, against the parliamentary system, against
          laissez-faire and<br>
          the liberal outlook, against nationalism (although in the name
          of<br>
          nationalism), against humanitarianism, against science and
          against all<br>
          respect for human dignity and human decency. It was recruited
          from the<br>
          dregs of society.<br>

          During the nineteenth century, goals were completely lost or
          were<br>
          <br>
          reduced to the most primitive level of obtaining more power
          and more<br>
          wealth. But the constant acquisition of power or wealth, like
          a<br>
          narcotic for which the need grows as its use increases without
          in any<br>
          way satisfying the user, left man's "higher" nature
          unsatisfied.<br>

          Germany could have made no aggression without the acquiescence<br>
          and even in some cases the actual encouragement of the
          "satisfied"<br>
          Powers, especially Britain.<br>
          <br>
          THE JAPANESE ASSAULT, 1931-1941<br>
          <br>
          The similarity between Germany and Japan was striking: each
          had a<br>
          completely cartelized industry, a militaristic tradition, a
          hardworking<br>
          population which respected authority and loved order, a facade<br>
          of parliamentary constitutionalism which barely concealed the
          reality<br>
          of power wielded by an alliance of army, landlords, and
          industry.<br>
          <br>
          Page 562<br>
          <br>
          The steady rise in tariffs against Japanese manufactured goods<br>
          after 1897 led by America served to increase the difficulties
          of<br>
          Japan's position. The world depression and the financial
          crisis hit<br>
          Japan a terrible blow. Under this impact, the reactionary and<br>
          aggressive forces were able to solidify their control and
          embark on<br>
          that adventure of aggression and destruction that ultimately
          led to<br>
          the disasters of 1945.<br>
          <br>
          Page 563<br>
          <br>
          Separate from the armed forces were the forces of monopoly<br>
          capitalism, the eight great economic complexes controlled as
          family<br>
          units knows as "zaibatsu" which controlled 75% of the nation's
          wealth.<br>
          By 1930, the militarists and zaibatsu came together in their
          last<br>
          fateful alliance.<br>
          <br>
          Page 569<br>
          <br>
          Japan's unfavorable balance of trade was reflected in a heavy<br>
          outflow of gold in 1937-1938. It was clear that Japan was
          losing its<br>
          financial and commercial ability to buy necessary materials of
          foreign<br>
          origin. The steps taken by America, Australia, and others to
          restrict<br>
          export of strategic or military materials to Japan made this
          problem<br>
          even more acute. The attack on China had been intended to
          remedy this<br>
          situation by removing the Chinese boycott on Japanese goods.<br>
          <br>
          Page 570<br>
          <br>
          Under the pressure of the growing reluctance of neutral
          countries<br>
          to supply Japan with necessary strategic goods, the most vital
          being<br>
          petroleum products and rubber, it seemed that the occupation
          of the<br>
          Dutch Indies and Malaya could do much to alleviate these
          shortages but<br>
          which would lead to an American war on Japan. They decided to
          attack<br>
          the United States first.<br>

          In 1922, the Fascists came to power in a parliamentary system;
          in<br>
          1925 it was replaced by a political dictatorship while the
          economic<br>
          system remained that of orthodox financial capitalism; in 1927
          an<br>
          orthodox and restrictive stabilization of the lira on the<br>
          &nbsp;(55 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          international gold standard led to such depressed economic
          conditions<br>
          that Mussolini adopted a much more active foreign policy; in
          1934<br>
          Italy replaced orthodox economic measures by a totalitarian
          economy<br>
          functioning beneath a fraudulent corporate facade.<br>
          <br>
          Italy was dissatisfied over its lack of colonial gains at<br>
          Versailles and the refusal of the League to accede to
          Tittoni's<br>
          request for a redistribution of the world's resources in
          accordance<br>
          with population needs made in 1920.<br>
          <br>
          In a series of agreements with Austria and Hungary known as
          the<br>
          "Rome Protocols," the Austrian government under Engelbert
          Dollfuss<br>
          destroyed the democratic institutions of Austria, wiped out
          all<br>
          Socialist and working-class organizations, and established a
          one-party<br>
          dictatorial corporate state at Mussolini's behest in 1934.
          Hitler took<br>
          advantage of this to attempt a Nazi coup in Austria, murdering<br>
          Dollfuss in July 1934 but he was prevented by the quick
          mobilization<br>
          of Italian troops on the Brenner frontier and a stern warning
          from<br>
          Mussolini.<br>
          <br>
          Page 572<br>
          <br>
          Hitler's ascension to office in Germany in 1933 found French<br>
          foreign policy paralyzed by British opposition to any efforts
          to<br>
          support collective security or to enforce German observation
          of its<br>
          treaty obligations by force. As a result, a suggestion from
          Poland in<br>
          1933 for joint armed intervention in Germany to remove Hitler
          from<br>
          office was rejected by France. Poland at once made an
          non-aggression<br>
          pact with Germany and extended a previous one with the Soviet
          Union.<br>
          In 1934, France under Jean Louis Bathou, began to adopt a more<br>
          active policy against Hitler seeking to encircle Germany by
          bringing<br>
          the Soviet Union and Italy into a revived alignment of France,
          Poland,<br>
          the Little Entente, Greece and Turkey.<br>
          <br>
          Page 573<br>
          <br>
          France's Laval was convinced that Italy could be brought into
          the<br>
          anti-German front only if its long-standing grievances and
          unfulfilled<br>
          ambitions in Africa could be met. Accordingly, he gave
          Mussolini 7% of<br>
          the stock in the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway, a stretch of
          desert<br>
          114,000 square miles in extent but containing only a few
          hundred<br>
          persons (sixty-two according to Mussolini) on the border of
          Libya, a<br>
          small wedge of territory between French Somaliland and Italian<br>
          Eritrea, and the right to ask for concessions throughout
          Ethiopia.<br>
          While Laval insisted that he had made no agreement which<br>
          jeopardized Ethiopia's independence or territorial integrity,
          he made<br>
          it equally clear that Italian support against Germany was more<br>
          important than the integrity of Ethiopia in his eyes. France
          had been<br>
          Ethiopia's only friend and had brought it into the League of
          Nations.<br>
          Italy had been prevented from conquering Ethiopia in 1896 only
          by a<br>
          decisive defeat of her invading forces at the hands of the
          Ethiopians<br>
          themselves, while in 1925, Britain and Italy had cut her up
          into<br>
          economic spheres by an agreement which was annulled by a
          French appeal<br>
          to the League. Laval's renunciation of France's traditional
          support of<br>
          Ethiopian independence brought Italy, Britain and France into<br>
          agreement on this issue.<br>
          <br>
          Page 574<br>
          <br>
          This point of view was not shared by public opinion in these<br>
          three countries. Stanley Baldwin (party leader and prime
          minister)<br>
          erected one of the most astonishing examples of British "dual"
          policy<br>
          in the appeasement period. While publicly supporting
          collective<br>
          security and sanctions against Italian aggression, the
          government<br>
          privately negotiated to destroy the League and to yield
          Ethiopia to<br>
          Italy. They were completely successful in this secret policy.<br>
          The Italian invaders had no real fear of British military<br>
          sanctions when they put a major part of their forces in the
          Red Sea<br>
          &nbsp;(56 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          separated from home by the British-controlled Suez canal. The
          British<br>
          government's position was clearly stated in a secret report by
          Sir<br>
          John Maffey which declared that Italian control of Ethiopia
          would be a<br>
          "matter of indifference" to Britain. This opinion was shared
          by the<br>
          French government too.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, public opinion was insisting on collective<br>
          sanctions against the aggressor. To meet this demand, both
          governments<br>
          engaged in a public policy of unenforced or partially enforced<br>
          sanctions at wide variance with their real intentions.<br>
          Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare delivered a smashing speech to<br>
          support sanctions against Italy. The day previously he and
          Anthony<br>
          Eden had secretly agreed with Pierre Laval to impose only
          partial<br>
          economic sanctions avoiding all actions such as blockade of
          the Suez<br>
          canal.<br>
          <br>
          Page 575<br>
          <br>
          A number of governments including Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
          France<br>
          and Britain had stopped all exports of munitions to Ethiopia
          as early<br>
          as May 1935 although Ethiopia's appeal to the League for help
          had been<br>
          made on March 17th while the Italian attack did not come until<br>
          October. The net result was that Ethiopia was left defenceless
          and her<br>
          appeal to the US for support was at once rejected.<br>
          Hoare's speech evoked such applause from the British public
          that<br>
          Baldwin decided to hold a general election on that issue.
          Accordingly,<br>
          with ringing pledge to support collective security, the
          National<br>
          government won an amazing victory and stayed in power until
          the next<br>
          general election ten years later (1945).<br>
          <br>
          Although Article 16 of the League Covenant bound the signers
          to<br>
          <br>
          break off all trade with an aggressor, France and Britain
          combined to<br>
          keep their economic sanctions partial and ineffective. The
          imposition<br>
          of oil sanctions was put off again and again until the
          conquest of<br>
          Ethiopia was complete. The refusal to establish this sanction
          resulted<br>
          from a joint British-French refusal on the grounds that an oil<br>
          sanction would be so effective that Italy would be compelled
          to break<br>
          of its was with Ethiopia and would, in desperation, make war
          on<br>
          Britain and France. This, at least, was the amazing logic
          offered by<br>
          the British government later.<br>
          <br>
          Page 576<br>
          <br>
          Hoare and Laval worked out a secret deal which would have
          given<br>
          Italy outright about one-sixth of Ethiopia. When news of this
          deal was<br>
          broken to the public, there was a roar of protest on the
          grounds<br>
          that this violated the election pledge made but a month
          previously. To<br>
          save his government, Baldwin had to sacrifice Hoare who
          resigned on<br>
          December 19 but returned to Cabinet on June 5 as soon as
          Ethiopia was<br>
          decently buried. Laval fell from office and was succeeded by
          Pierre<br>
          Flandin who pursued the same policy.<br>
          <br>
          Ethiopia was conquered on May 2 1936. Sanctions were removed
          in<br>
          the next two months just as they were beginning to take
          effect. The<br>
          consequences of the Ethiopian fiasco were of the greatest
          importance.<br>
          The Conservative Party in England was entrenched in office for
          a<br>
          decade during which it carried out its policy of appeasement
          and waged<br>
          the resulting war. The US passed a "Neutrality Act" which
          encouraged<br>
          aggression, at the outbreak of war, by cutting off supplies to
          both<br>
          sides, to the aggressor who had armed at his leisure and to
          the victim<br>
          as yet unarmed. Above all, it destroyed French efforts to
          encircle<br>
          Germany.<br>

          The remilitarization of the Rhineland in violation of the<br>

          crisis.<br>

          <br>
          In order to destroy the French and Soviet alliances with<br>
          Czechoslovakia, Britain and Germany sought to encircle France
          and the<br>
          Soviet Union in order to dissuade France from honoring its
          alliances<br>
          with either Czechoslovakia or the Soviet Union and France,
          finding<br>
          itself encircled, dishonored its alliance with Czechoslovakia
          when it<br>
          came due in 1938.<br>
          <br>
          Page 579<br>
          <br>
          The British attitude towards eastern Europe was made perfectly<br>
          clear when Sir John Simon demanded arms equality for Germany.
          Adding<br>
          to the encirclement of France was the Anglo-German Naval
          Agreement of<br>
          June 1935.<br>
          <br>
          Page 580<br>
          <br>
          Parallel with the encirclement of France went the encirclement
          of<br>
          the Soviet Union known as the anti-Comintern Pact, the union
          of<br>
          Germany and Japan against Communism.<br>
          <br>
          The last encirclement was that against Czechoslovakia. Hungary<br>
          and Germany were both opposed to Czechoslovakia as an
          "artificial"<br>
          creation of the Versailles Conference. The Polish-German
          agreement of<br>
          1934 opened a campaign until the Polish invasion in 1938.<br>
          An analysis of the motivations of Britain in 1938-1939 is
          bound<br>
          to be difficult because the motives of government were clearly
          not the<br>
          same as the motives of the people and in no country has
          secrecy and<br>
          anonymity been carried so has been been so well preserved as
          in<br>
          Britain. In general, motives become vaguer and less secret as
          we move<br>
          our attention from the innermost circles of the government
          outward. As<br>
          if we were looking at the layers of an onion, we may discern
          four<br>
          points of view:<br>
          <br>
          1) the anti-Bolsheviks at the center;<br>
          2) the "three-bloc-world" supporters close to the center;<br>
          3) the supporters of "appeasement" and<br>
          4) the "peace at any price" group in peripheral position.<br>

          The chief figures in the anti-Bolshevik group were Lord<br>
          Curzon, Lord D'Abernon and General Smuts. They did what they
          could to<br>
          destroy reparations and permit German re-armament.<br>
          This point of view was supported by the second group, the
          Round<br>
          Table Group, and came later to be called the Clivenden Set
          which<br>
          included Lord Milner, Lord Brand (managing director of Lazard<br>
          Brothers, international bankers). This group wielded great
          influence<br>
          because it controlled the Rhodes Trust and dominated the Royal<br>
          Institute of International Affairs. They sought to contain the
          Soviet<br>
          Union rather than destroy it as the anti-Bolsheviks wanted.
          They<br>
          advocated a secret alliance of Britain with the German
          military<br>
          leaders against the Soviet.<br>

          Abandoning Austria, Czechoslovakia and the Polish Corridor to<br>
          Germany was the aim of both the anti-Bolsheviks and the
          "three-bloc"<br>
          people.<br>

          From August 1935 to March 1939, the government built upon the<br>
          fears of the "peace at any price" group by steadily
          exaggerating<br>
          Germany's armed might and belittling their own, by calculated<br>
          indiscretions like the statement that there were no real
          anti-aircraft<br>
          guns in London, by constant hammering at the danger of air
          attack<br>
          without warning, by building ostentatious and quite useless
          air-raid<br>
          trenches in the streets and parks of London, and by insisting
          through<br>
          daily warnings that everyone must be fitted with a gas mask<br>
          immediately (although the danger of a gas attack was nil). In
          this<br>
          way, the government put London into a panic in 1938 and by
          this panic,<br>
          Chamberlain was able to get the people to accept the
          destruction of<br>
          &nbsp;(58 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          Czechoslovakia. Since he could not openly appeal on the anti-<br>
          Bolshevik basis, he had to adopt the expedient of pretending
          to<br>
          resist (in order to satisfy the British public) while really<br>
          continuing to make every possible concession to Hitler which
          would<br>
          bring Germany to a common frontier with the Soviet Union.<br>
          <br>
          Page 585<br>
          <br>
          Chamberlain's motives were not really bad ones; he wanted
          peace<br>
          so he could devote Britain's limited resources to social
          welfare; but<br>
          he was narrow and totally ignorant of the realities of power,<br>
          convinced that international politics could be conducted in
          terms of<br>
          secret deals, as business was, and he was quite ruthless in
          carrying<br>
          out his aims, especially in his readiness to sacrifice
          non-English<br>
          persons who, in his eyes, did not count.<br>

          THE SPANISH TRAGEDY, 1931-1939<br>
          <br>
          Page 587<br>
          <br>
          From the invasion of the Arabs in 711 to their final ejection
          in<br>
          1492, Spanish life has been dominated by the struggle against
          foreign<br>
          intruders. As a result of more than a thousand years of such<br>
          struggles, almost all elements of Spanish society have
          developed a<br>
          fanatical intolerance, an uncompromising individualism, and a
          fatal<br>
          belief that physical force is a solution to all problems,
          however<br>
          spiritual.<br>
          <br>
          Page 588<br>
          <br>
          The war of 1898, by depriving Spain of much of its empire,
          left<br>
          its over-sized army with little to do and with a reduced area
          on which<br>
          to batten. Like a vampire octopus, the Spanish Army settled
          down to<br>
          drain the life-blood of Spain and, above all, Morocco. This
          brought<br>
          the army officers into alignment with conservative forces
          consisting<br>
          of the Church (upper clergy), the landlords, and the
          monarchists. The<br>
          forces of the proletariat discontent consisted of the urban
          workers<br>
          and the much larger mass of exploited peasants.<br>
          <br>
          Page 591<br>
          <br>
          In 1923, while most of Spain was suffering from malnutrition,<br>
          most of the land was untilled and the owners refused to use
          irrigation<br>
          facilities which had built by government. As a result,
          agricultural<br>
          yields were the poorest in western Europe. While 15 men owned
          about a<br>
          million acres and 15,000 men owned about the of all taxed
          land, almost<br>
          2 million owned the other half, frequently in plots too small
          for<br>
          subsistence. About 2 million more, who were completely
          landless,<br>
          worked 10 to 14 hours a day for about 2.5 pesetas (35 cents) a
          day for<br>
          only six months in the year and paid exorbitant rents without
          any<br>
          security of tenure.<br>
          <br>
          In the Church, while the ordinary priests share the poverty
          and<br>
          tribulations of the people, the upper clergy were closely
          allied with<br>
          government and supported by an annual grant. They had seats in
          the<br>
          upper chamber, control of education, censorship, marriage. In<br>
          consequence of this alliance of the upper clergy with
          government and<br>
          the forces of reaction, all animosities built against the
          latter came<br>
          to be directed against the former also. Although the people
          remained<br>
          universally and profoundly catholic, they also became
          incredibly<br>
          anticlerical reflected in the proclivity for burning churches.<br>
          All these groups, landlords, officers, upper clergy, and<br>
          monarchists, were interest groups seeking to utilize Spain for
          their<br>
          own power and profit.<br>
          <br>

          Alfonso XIII ordered municipal elections but in 46 out of 50<br>
          provincial capitals, the anti-monarchial forces were
          victorious.<br>
          Alfonso fled to France on April 14, 1931.<br>
          The republicans at once began to organize their victory,
          electing<br>
          a Constituent Assembly in June and establishing an ultramodern
          uni <br>
          <br>
          (59 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          cameral, parliamentary government with universal suffrage,
          separation<br>
          of Church and State, secularization of education, local
          autonomy for<br>
          separatist areas and power to socialize the great estates or
          the<br>
          public utilities.<br>
          <br>
          The republic lasted only five years before Civil War began in<br>
          1936 after being challenged constantly from the Right and the
          extreme<br>
          Left. Because of shifting governments, the liberal program
          which was<br>
          enacted into law in 1931 was annulled or unenforced.<br>
          <br>
          Page 593<br>
          <br>
          In an effort to reduce illiteracy (over 45% in 1930), the<br>
          republic created thousands of new schools and new teachers,
          raised<br>
          teachers' salaries, founded over a thousand libraries.<br>
          Army officers were reduced with the surplus being retired on
          full<br>
          pay. The republican officers tended to retire, the monarchists
          to stay<br>
          on.<br>
          <br>
          To assist the peasants and workers, mixed juries were
          established<br>
          to hear rural rent disputes, importation of labor for
          wage-breaking<br>
          purposes was forbidden; and credit was provided for peasants
          to<br>
          obtain land, seed, or fertilizers on favorable terms.
          Customarily<br>
          uncultivated lands were expropriated with compensation to
          provide<br>
          farms for a new class of peasant proprietors.<br>
          Most of these reforms went into effect only partially. Few of
          the<br>
          abandoned estates could be expropriated because of the lack of
          money<br>
          for compensation.<br>
          <br>
          Page 594<br>
          <br>
          The conservative groups reacted violently. Three plots began
          to<br>
          be formed against the new republic, the one monarchist led by
          Sotelo<br>
          in parliament and by Goicoechea behind the scenes; the second
          a<br>
          parliamentary alliance of landlords and clericals under
          Robles; and<br>
          the last a conspiracy of officers under Generals Barrera and
          Sanjurjo.<br>
          In the meantime, the monarchist conspiracy was organized by<br>
          former King Alfonso from abroad. Goicoechea performed his task
          with<br>
          great skill under the eyes of a government which refused to
          take<br>
          preventative action because of its own liberal and legalistic<br>
          scruples. He organized an alliance of the officers, the
          Carlists, and<br>
          his own Alfonsist party. Four men from these three groups then
          signed<br>
          an agreement with Mussolini in 1934 who promised arms, money,<br>
          diplomatic support and 1.5 million pesetas, 10,000
          rifles,10,000<br>
          grenades, and 200 machine guns. In return, the signers
          promised to<br>
          sign a joint export policy with Italy.<br>
          <br>
          Page 595<br>
          <br>
          The Robles coalition of Right parties with the clerical party
          and<br>
          agrarian party of landlords was able to replace the Left
          Republican<br>
          Azana by the Right Republican Lerroux as prime minister. It
          then<br>
          called new elections, won victory and revoked many of the 1931
          reforms<br>
          while allowing most of the rest to go unenforced and restored<br>
          expropriated estates.<br>
          <br>
          This led to a violent agitation which burst into open revolt
          in<br>
          the two separatist centers of the Basque country and
          Catalonia. The<br>
          uprising in Asturias spearheaded by anarchist miners hurling
          dynamite<br>
          from slings, lasted for nine days. The government used the
          Foreign<br>
          Legion and Moors, brought to Morocco by sea, and crushed the
          rebels<br>
          without mercy. The latter suffered at 5,000 casualties. After
          the<br>
          uprising, 25,000 suspects were thrown into prison.<br>
          The uprising of October 1934, although crushed, split the<br>
          oligarchy. The demands of the army, monarchists and the
          biggest<br>
          landlords for a ruthless dictatorship alarmed the leaders of
          the<br>
          Church and president of the republic Zamora. Robles as
          minister of war<br>
          encouraged reactionary control of the army and even put
          General Franco<br>
          in as his undersecretary of war.<br>

          &nbsp;(60 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          For the 1936 elections, the parties of the Left formed the<br>
          Popular Front with a published program promising a full
          restoration of<br>
          the constitution, amnesty for political crimes committed after
          1933,<br>
          civil liberties, an independent judiciary, minimum wages,
          protection<br>
          for tenants, reform of taxation, credit, banking. It
          repudiated the<br>
          Socialist program for nationalization of the land, the banks,
          and<br>
          industry.<br>
          <br>
          While all the Popular Front parties would support the
          government,<br>
          only the bourgeois parties would hold seats in the Cabinet
          while the<br>
          workers parties such as the Socialists would remain outside.<br>
          The Popular Front captured 266 of 473 seats while the Right
          had<br>
          153, the Center 54, CEDA 96, Socialists 87, Republic Left 81,<br>
          Communists 14.<br>
          <br>
          The defeated forces of the Right refused to accept the
          election<br>
          results and tried to persuade Valladeres to hand over the
          government<br>
          to General Franco. That was rebuffed. On Feb. 20, the
          conspirators met<br>
          and decided the time was not yet ripe. The new government
          heard of<br>
          this meeting and transferred Franco to the Canary Islands. The
          day<br>
          before he left Madrid, Franco met with the chief conspirators
          and they<br>
          completed their plans for a military revolt but fixed no date.<br>
          In the meantime, provocation, assassination, and retaliation
          grew<br>
          steadily with the verbal encouragement of the Right. Property
          was<br>
          seized or destroyed and churches were burned on all sides. The
          mob<br>
          retaliated by assaults on monarchists and by burning churches.<br>
          <br>
          Page 597<br>
          <br>
          Italian Air Force planes were painted over and went into
          action<br>
          in support of the revolt which was a failure when the navy
          remained<br>
          loyal because the crews overthrew their officers; the Air
          Force<br>
          remained loyal; the army revolted with much of the police but
          were<br>
          overcome. At the first news of the revolt, the people, led by
          labor<br>
          unions, demanded arms. Because arms were lacking, orders were
          sent at<br>
          once to France. The recognized government in Madrid had the
          right to<br>
          buy arms abroad and was even bound to do so by treaty with
          France.<br>
          As a result of the failure of the revolt, the generals found<br>
          themselves isolated in several different parts of Spain with
          no mass<br>
          popular support.<br>
          <br>
          Page 598<br>
          <br>
          The rebels held the extreme northwest, the north and the south
          as<br>
          well as Morocco and the islands. They had the unlimited
          support of<br>
          Italy and Portugal and tentative support from Germany.<br>
          The French suggested an agreement not to intervene in Spain
          since<br>
          it was clear that if there was no intervention, the Spanish
          government<br>
          could suppress the rebels. Britain accept the French offer at
          once but<br>
          efforts to get Portugal, Italy, Germany and Russia into the
          agreement<br>
          were difficult because Portugal and Italy were both helping
          the<br>
          rebels. By August, all six Powers had agreed.<br>
          <br>
          Efforts to establish some kind of supervision were rejected by<br>
          the rebels and by Portugal while Britain refused to permit any<br>
          restrictions to be placed on war material going to Portugal at
          the<br>
          very moment when it was putting all kinds of pressure on
          France to<br>
          restrict any flow of supplies to the recognized government of
          Spain.<br>
          Portugal had delayed joining the agreement until it would hurt
          the<br>
          Loyalist forces more than the rebels. Even then, there was no<br>
          intention of observing the agreements.<br>
          <br>
          Page 599<br>
          <br>
          France did little to help the Madrid government while Britain
          was<br>
          positively hostile to it. Both governments stopped all
          shipments of<br>
          war material to Spain. By its insistence on enforcing
          non-intervention<br>
          against the Loyalists, while ignoring the systematic and
          large-scale<br>
          evasions of the agreement in behalf of the rebels, Britain was
          neither<br>
          &nbsp;(61 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          fair nor neutral, and had to engage in large-scale violations
          of<br>
          international law. Britain refuse to permit any restrictions
          to be<br>
          placed on war material going to Portugal (to the rebels). It
          refused<br>
          to allow the Loyalist Spanish Navy to blockade the seaports
          held by<br>
          the rebels, and took immediate action against efforts by the
          Madrid<br>
          government to interfere with any kind of shipments to rebel
          areas,<br>
          while wholesale assaults by the rebels on British and other
          neutral<br>
          ships going to Loyalist areas drew little more than feeble
          protests<br>
          from Britain.<br>
          <br>
          Britain was clearly seeking a rebel victory and instead of
          trying<br>
          to enforce nonintervention, was actively supporting the rebel
          blockade<br>
          of Loyalist Spain when the British Navy began, in 1937, to
          intercept<br>
          British ships headed for Loyalist ports and on some pretext,
          or simply<br>
          by force, made them go elsewhere.<br>
          <br>
          The rebel forces were fewer than the Loyalists but were<br>
          eventually successful because of their great superiority in
          artillery,<br>
          aviation, and tanks as a result of the one-sided enforcement
          of the<br>
          non-intervention agreement.<br>

          The failure of Franco to capture Madrid led to a joint
          Italian-<br>
          German meeting where it was decided to recognize the Franco
          government<br>
          and withdraw their recognition from Madrid on Nov. 18, 1936.
          Japan<br>
          recognized the Franco regime in December.<br>
          <br>
          As a result, Franco received the full support of the aggressor<br>
          states while the Loyalist government was obstructed in every
          way by<br>
          the "peace-loving" Powers. Italy sent 100,000 men and suffered
          50,000<br>
          casualties, Germany sent 20,000 men. On the other side, the
          Loyalists<br>
          were cut off from foreign supplies almost at once because of
          the<br>
          embargoes of the Great Powers and obtained only limited
          amounts,<br>
          chiefly from Mexico, Russia and the US until the
          Non-intervention<br>
          agreement cut these off. On Jan. 18, 1937, the American
          Neutrality Act<br>
          was revised to apply to civil as well as international wars
          and was<br>
          invoked against Spain immediately but unofficial pressure from
          the<br>
          American government prevented such exports to Spain even
          earlier.<br>
          The Madrid government made violent protests against the Axis<br>
          intervention both before the Non-intervention Committee in
          London and<br>
          before the League of Nations. These were denied by the Axis
          Powers. An<br>
          investigation of these charges was made under Soviet pressure
          but the<br>
          Committee reported that these charges were unproved. Anthony
          Eden went<br>
          so far to say that so far as non-intervention was concerned,
          "there<br>
          were other governments more to blame tan either Germany or
          Italy."<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Soviet intervention began Oct 7,1936, three and a half years<br>
          after Italian intervention and almost three months after both
          Italian<br>
          and German units were fighting with the rebels. The Third<br>
          International recruited volunteers throughout the world to
          fight in<br>
          Spain. This Soviet intervention in support of the Madrid
          government at<br>
          a time when it could find support almost nowhere else served
          to<br>
          increase Communist influence in the government very greatly.<br>
          <br>
          Page 602<br>
          <br>
          The Italian submarine fleet was waiting for Russian shipping
          in<br>
          the Mediterranean and did not hesitate to sink it in the last
          few<br>
          months of 1936.<br>
          <br>
          Although the evidence for Axis intervention in Spain was<br>
          overwhelming and was admitted by the Powers themselves early
          in 1937,<br>
          the British refused to admit it and refused to modify the
          nonintervention<br>
          policy. Britain's attitude was so devious that it can<br>
          hardly be untangled although the results were clear enough.
          The real<br>
          sympathy of the London government clearly favored the rebels
          although<br>
          it had to conceal the fact from public opinion since this
          opinion<br>
          favored the Loyalists over Franco by 57% to 7% according to a
          1938<br>

          On December 18, 1936, Eden admitted that the government had<br>
          exaggerated the danger of war four months earlier to get the
          nonintervention<br>
          agreement accepted, and when Britain wanted to use force<br>
          to achieve its aims, as it did in the piracy of Italian
          submarines in<br>
          1937, it did so without risk of war. The non-intervention
          agreement,<br>
          as practiced, was neither an aid to peace nor an example of<br>
          neutrality, but was clearly enforced in such a way as to give
          aid to<br>
          the rebels and place all possible obstacles in the way of the
          Loyalist<br>
          government suppressing the rebellion.<br>
          <br>
          The attitude of the British government could not be admitted<br>
          publicly and every effort was made to picture the actions of
          the Nonintervention<br>
          Committee as one of even-handed neutrality. In fact, it<br>
          was used to throw dust in the eyes of the world, especially
          the<br>
          British public. For months, the meaningless debates of this
          committee<br>
          were reported in detail to the world and charges,
          countercharges,<br>
          proposals, counterproposals, investigations and inconclusive<br>
          conclusions were offered to the a confused world, thus
          successfully<br>
          increasing its confusion. While debating and quibbling on
          about issues<br>
          like belligerence, patrols, volunteers, etc., before the
          Committee in<br>
          London, the Franco forces, with their foreign contingents,
          slowly<br>
          crushed the Loyalist forces.<br>
          <br>
          Page 604<br>
          <br>
          The Loyalist forces surrendered on March 28th 1939. England
          and<br>
          France had recognized the Franco government on February 17 and
          the<br>
          Axis troops were evacuated from Spain after a triumphal march
          through<br>
          Madrid in June.<br>
          <br>
          When the war ended, much of Spain was wrecked, at least
          450,000<br>
          Spaniards had been killed and an unpopular military
          dictatorship had<br>
          been imposed as a result of the actions of non-Spanish forces.
          At<br>
          least 400,000 Spaniards were in prison and large numbers were
          hungry<br>
          and destitute. Germany recognized this problem and tried to
          get France<br>
          to follow a path of conciliation, humanitarian reform, and
          social,<br>
          agricultural, and economic reform. This advice was rejected,
          with the<br>
          result that Spain has remained weak, apathetic, war-weary, and<br>
          discontented ever since.<br>

          The Austria which was left after the Treaty of St. Germain<br>
          consisted of little more than the great city of Vienna
          surrounded by a<br>
          huge but inadequate suburb whose population had been reduced
          from 52<br>
          to 6.6 million.<br>

          The Social Democrats were unable to reconcile their desire for<br>
          union with Germany (called Anschluss) with the need for
          financial aid<br>
          from the Entente Powers who opposed this.<br>
          The Social Democrats embarked on an amazing program of social<br>
          welfare by a system of direct taxes which bore heavily on the
          well-todo.<br>
          <br>
          Page 609<br>
          <br>
          Before 1914, the living conditions of the poor had been<br>
          maintained by a very undemocratic political system under which
          only<br>
          83,000 persons, on a property basis, were allowed to vote and
          5,500 of<br>
          the richest were allowed to choose one-third of all seats on
          city<br>
          council. By 1933, the Social Democrats had built almost 60,000<br>
          dwellings so efficiently that the average cost per apartment
          was only<br>
          about $1,650 each with average rent of $2 per month. Thus the
          poor of<br>
          Vienna had all kinds of free or cheap medical care, dental
          care,<br>
          education, libraries, amusements, sports, school lunches and
          maternity<br>
          care provided by the city.<br>
          <br>
          While this was going on in Vienna, the Christian
          Socialist-Pan-<br>
          German federal government of Catholic priest Monsignor Ignaz
          Seipel<br>
          was sinking deeper into corruption, The diversion of public
          funds to<br>
          banks and industries controlled by Seipel's supporters was
          revealed by<br>
          parliamentary investigations in spite of the government's
          efforts to<br>
          conceal the facts.<br>
          <br>
          Seipel formed a "Unity List" of all the anti-Socialist parties
          he<br>
          could muster but the election gave his party only 73 seats
          compared to<br>
          71 for the Social Democrats, 12 for the pan-Germans, 9 for the<br>
          Agrarian League. He sought to change the Austrian constitution
          into a<br>
          presidential dictatorship which required a two-thirds vote. It
          became<br>
          necessary to use illegal methods.<br>

          <br>
          The secret documents published since 1945 make it quite clear<br>
          that Germany had no carefully laid plans to annex Austria and
          was not<br>
          encouraging violence by the Nazis in Austria. Instead, every
          effort<br>
          was made to restrict the Austrian Nazis to propaganda in order
          to win<br>
          a gradual peaceful extension of Nazi influence.<br>
          <br>
          Page 611<br>
          <br>
          The invasion of Austria in 1938 was a pleasant surprise even
          for<br>
          the Nazi leaders and arose from several unexpected favorable<br>
          circumstances. Secret documents now make it clear that in 1937
          the<br>
          German and British governments made secret decisions which
          sealed the<br>
          fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia. It is evident from some of<br>
          Hitler's statements that he had already received certain
          information<br>
          about the secret decisions being made by Chamberlain on the
          British<br>
          side.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The British government group controlling foreign policy had<br>
          reached a seven point decision regarding Germany:<br>
          <br>
          1. Hitler's Germany was the front-line bulwark against the
          spread of<br>
          Communism in Europe.<br>
          2. The aim was a four power pact including Britain, France,
          Italy and<br>
          Germany to exclude all Russian influence from Europe.<br>
          3. Britain had no objection to German acquisition of Austria,<br>
          Czechoslovakia, and Danzig.<br>
          4. Germany must not use force to achieve its aims as this
          would<br>
          precipitate a war in which Britain would have to intervene.<br>

          <br>
          For years before June 1938, the government insisted that
          British<br>
          rearming was progressing in a satisfactory fashion. Churchill<br>
          questioned this and produced figures on German rearmament to
          prove<br>
          that Britain's own progress in this field was inadequate.
          These<br>
          &nbsp;(64 of 129)<br>
          <br>
          figures (which were not correct) were denied by the
          government. As<br>
          late as March 1938, Chamberlain said that British rearmament
          were such<br>
          as to make Britain an "almost terrifying power." But as the
          year went<br>
          on, the government adopted a quite different attitude. In
          order to<br>
          persuade public opinion that it was necessary to yield to
          Germany, the<br>
          government pretended that its armaments were quite inadequate.<br>
          <br>
          Page 623<br>
          <br>
          We now know that this was a gross exaggeration. Britain
          produced<br>
          almost 3000 "military" planes in 1938 and about 8,000 in 1939
          compared<br>
          to 3350 "combat" planes produced in Germany in 1938 and 4,733
          in 1939.<br>
          It is quite clear that Britain did not yield to superior force
          in<br>
          1938, as was stated at the time and has been stated since by
          many<br>
          writers including Churchill. We have evidence that Chamberlain
          knew<br>
          these facts but consistently gave a contrary impression and
          that Lord<br>
          Halifax went so far as to call forth protests from the British<br>
          military attaches in Prague and Paris.<br>
          <br>
          The British government made it clear to Germany both publicly
          and<br>
          privately that they would not oppose Germany's projects.
          Dirksen wrote<br>
          to Ribbentrop on June 3 1928 "Anything which could be got
          without<br>
          firing a shot can count upon the agreement of the British."<br>

          <br>
          The economic discontent became stronger after the onset of the<br>
          world depression in 1929 and especially after Hitler
          demonstrated that<br>
          his policies could bring prosperity to Germany.<br>

          Page 627<br>
          <br>
          Within two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, Britain
          put<br>
          pressure on the Czechs to make concessions to the Germans; to<br>
          encourage France and Germany to do the same. All this was
          justified by<br>
          the argument that Germany would be satisfied if it obtained
          the<br>
          Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor. All these assumptions
          were<br>
          dubious.<br>

          Czechoslovakia was eliminated with the help of German
          aggression,<br>
          French indecision and war-weariness, and British public
          appeasement<br>
          and merciless secret pressure.<br>

          Five days after Anschluss, the Soviet government call for<br>
          collective actions to stop aggression and to eliminate the
          increased<br>
          danger of a new world slaughter was rejected by Lord Halifax.<br>
          <br>
          Page 633<br>
          <br>
          It was necessary to impose the plan for Czechoslovakia on
          public<br>
          opinion of the world by means of the slowly mounting war scare
          which<br>
          reached the level of absolute panic on September 28th. The
          mounting<br>
          horror of the relentless German mobilization was built up day
          by day<br>
          while Britain and France ordered the Czechs not to mobilize in
          order<br>
          "not to provoke Germany."<br>
          We now know that all these statements and rumors were not true<br>
          and that the British government knew that they were not true
          at the<br>
          time.<br>
          <br>
          Page 634<br>
          <br>
          The Chamberlain government knew these facts but consistently
          gave<br>
          a contrary impression. Lord Halifax particularly distorted the
          facts.<br>
          Just as the crisis was reaching the boiling point in September<br>
          1938, the British ambassador in Paris reported to London that
          Colonel<br>
          Lindbergh had just emerged from Germany with a report that
          Germany had<br>
          8,000 military planes and could manufacture 1,500 a month. We
          now know<br>
          that Germany had about 1,500 planes, manufactured 280 a month.<br>
          <br>
          Page 635<br>
          <br>
          Lindbergh repeated his tale of woe daily both in Paris and in<br>

          that<br>
          might contribute to a strong or a united resistance to Germany
          was<br>
          played down.<br>

          Halifax at once ordered the Czech police to be withdrawn from
          the<br>

          Germany was supreme in Europe. Since this was exactly what
          Chamberlain<br>
          and his friends had wanted, they should have been satisfied.<br>

          Concessions to Germany continued but now parallel with<br>
          concessions went a real effort to build up a strong front
          against<br>
          Hitler.<br>
          <br>
          Page 643<br>

          The anti-Bolshevik and "three-bloc-world" groups had expected<br>
          Hitler would get the Sudetenland, Danzig, and perhaps the
          Polish<br>
          Corridor and that he would then be stabilized between the
          "oceanic<br>
          bloc" and the Soviet Union.<br>
          <br>
          As a result of these hidden and conflicting forces, the
          history<br>
          of international relations from September 1938 and September
          1939 or<br>
          even later is neither simple nor consistent. In general, the
          key to<br>
          everything was the position of Britain. As a result of Lord
          Halifax's<br>
          "dyarchic" policy, there were not only two policies but two
          groups<br>
          carrying them out. Lord Halifax tried to satisfy the public
          demand for<br>
          an end to appeasement while Chamberlain, Wilson, Simon and
          Hoare<br>
          sought to make secret concessions to Hitler in order to
          achieve a<br>
          general Anglo-German settlement. The one policy was public;
          the other<br>
          was secret. Since the Foreign Office knew of both, it tried to
          build<br>
          up the "peace front" against Germany so that it would look<br>
          sufficiently imposing to satisfy public opinion and to drive
          Hitler to<br>
          seek his desires by negotiation rather than by force so that
          public<br>
          opinion in England would not force the government to declare a
          war<br>
          that they did not want in order to remain in office. This
          complex plan<br>
          broke down because Hitler was determined to have a war merely
          for the<br>
          personal emotional thrill of wielding great power, while the
          effort to<br>
          make a "peace front" sufficiently collapsible so that it could
          be case<br>
          aside if Hitler either obtained his goals by negotiation or
          made a<br>
          general settlement with Chamberlain merely resulted in making
          a "peace<br>
          front" which was so weak it could neither maintain peace by
          threat of<br>
          force nor win a war when peace was lost.<br>

          On March 15th, Chamberlain told the Commons that he accepted
          the<br>
          seizure of Czechoslovakia and refused to accuse Hitler of bad
          faith.<br>
          But two days later, when the howls of rage from the British
          public<br>
          showed that he had misjudged the electorate, he denounced the
          seizure.<br>
          However, nothing was done other than to recall Henderson from
          Berlin<br>
          for consultations and cancel a visit to Berlin by the
          president of the<br>
          Board of Trade. The seizure was declared illegal but was
          recognized in<br>
          fact at once. Moreover, #6 million in Czech gold reserves in
          London<br>
          were turned over to Germany with the puny and untrue excuse
          that the<br>

          Germany opened its negotiations with Poland in a fairly
          friendly<br>
          way on October 24, 1938. It asked for Danzig and a strip a
          kilometer<br>
          wide across the Polish Corridor to provide a highway and
          four-track<br>
          railroad under German sovereignty. Poland's economic and
          harbor rights<br>
          in Danzig were to be guaranteed and the "corridor across the
          Corridor"<br>
          was to be isolated from Polish communications facilities by
          bridging<br>
          or tunneling. Germany also wanted Poland to join an
          anti-Russian bloc.<br>
          Germany was prepared to guarantee the country's existing
          frontiers, to<br>
          extend the Non-aggression Pact of 1934 for 25 years, to
          guarantee the<br>
          independence of Slovakia and to dispose of Ruthenia as Poland
          wished.<br>
          These suggestions were rejected by Poland. About the same
          time, the<br>
          Germans were using pressure on Romania to obtain an economic
          agreement<br>
          which was signed on March 23rd.<br>
          <br>
          On March 17, London received a false report of a German
          ultimatum<br>
          to Romania. Lord Halifax lost his head and, without checking
          his<br>
          information, sent telegrams to Greece, Turkey, Poland,
          Bulgaria,<br>
          Soviet Union asking what each country was prepared to do in
          the event<br>
          of a German aggression against Romania. Four replied by asking
          London<br>
          what it was prepared to do but Moscow suggested and immediate<br>
          conference which Halifax rebuffed, wanting nothing more than
          an<br>
          agreement to consult in a crisis. Poland was reluctant to sign
          any<br>
          agreement involving Russia. However, when news reached London
          of<br>
          Hitler's demands on Poland, Britain suddenly issued a
          unilateral<br>
          guarantee of the latter state (March 31st).<br>
          <br>
          Page 648<br>
          <br>
          "In the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish<br>
          independence and which the Polish government accordingly
          considered it<br>
          vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's
          Government<br>
          would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish
          Government all<br>
          support in their power."<br>
          <br>
          This was an extraordinary assurance. The British government<br>
          since 1918 had resolutely refused any bilateral agreement
          guaranteeing<br>
          any state in western Europe. Now they were making a
          "unilateral"<br>
          declaration in "eastern" Europe and they were giving that
          state the<br>
          responsibility of deciding when that guarantee would take
          effect,<br>
          something quite unprecedented. If Germany used force in
          Poland, public<br>
          opinion in Britain would force Britain to declare war whether
          there<br>
          was a guarantee or not.<br>
          <br>
          If the chief purpose of the unilateral guarantee to Poland was
          to<br>
          frighten Germany, it had precisely the opposite effect.<br>
          <br>
          Page 649<br>
          <br>
          Hitler announced that the terms he had offered Poland had been<br>
          rejected, negotiations broken off. The crisis was intensified
          by<br>
          provocative acts on both sides.<br>
          <br>
          Page 650<br>
          <br>
          In 1939, there was talk of a British loan to Poland of #100<br>
          million in May; On August 1 Poland finally got a credit for $8
          million<br>
          at a time when all London was buzzing about a secret loan of
          #1<br>
          billion from Britain to Germany.<br>
          <br>
          In 1936, Poland was given 2 billion francs as a rearmament
          long<br>
          and on May 19, 1939, an agreement was signed by which France
          promised<br>
          full air support to Poland on the first day of war, local
          skirmishing<br>
          by the third day, and a full-scale offensive on the sixteenth
          day. On<br>
          Aug. 23, General Gamelin informed his government that no
          military<br>
          support could be given to Poland until the spring of 1940 and
          that a<br>
          full-scale offensive could not be made before 1941-1942.
          Poland was<br>
          never informed of this change and seems to have entered the
          war on<br>
          September 1st in the belief that a full-scale offensive would
          be made<br>
          &nbsp;(67 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          against Germany during September.<br>
          <br>
          The failure to support Poland was probably deliberate in the<br>
          hope that this would force Poland to negotiate with Hitler. If
          so, it<br>
          was a complete failure. Poland was so encouraged by the
          British<br>
          guarantee that it not only refused to make concessions but
          also<br>
          prevented the reopening of negotiations by one excuse after
          another<br>
          until the last day of peace.<br>
          <br>
          Page 651<br>
          <br>
          In light of these facts, the British efforts to reach a<br>
          settlement with Hitler and their reluctance to make an
          alliance with<br>
          Russia, were very unrealistic. Nevertheless, they continued to
          exhort<br>
          the Poles to reopen negotiations with Hitler, and continued to
          inform<br>
          the German government that the justice of their claims to
          Danzig and<br>
          the Corridor were recognized but that these claims must be
          fulfilled<br>
          by peaceful means and that force would inevitably be met with
          force.<br>
          The British continued to emphasize that the controversy was
          over<br>
          Danzig when everyone else knew that Danzig was merely a
          detail, and an<br>
          almost indefensible detail. Danzig was no issue on which to
          fight a<br>
          world war, but it was an issue on which negotiation was almost<br>
          mandatory. This may have been why Britain insisted that it was
          the<br>
          chief issue. But because it was not the chief issue, Poland
          refused to<br>
          negotiate because it feared it would lead to partition of
          Poland.<br>
          Danzig was a free city under supervision of the League of
          Nations<br>
          and while it was within the Polish customs and under Polish
          economic<br>
          control, it was already controlled politically under a German<br>
          Gauleiter and would at any moment vote to join Germany if
          Hitler<br>
          consented.<br>
          <br>
          Page 654<br>
          <br>
          Lord Halifax's report reads: "Herr Hitler asked whether
          England<br>
          would be willing to accept an alliance with Germany. I said I
          did not<br>
          exclude such a possibility provided the development of events<br>
          justified it."<br>
          <br>
          The theory that Russia learned of these British approaches to<br>
          Germany in July 1939 is supported by the fact that the
          obstacles and<br>
          delays in the path of a British-Russian agreement were made by
          Britain<br>
          from the middle of April to the second week of July but were
          made by<br>
          Russia from the second week in July to the end on August 21st.<br>
          The Russians probably regarded the first British suggestion<br>
          that the Soviet Union should give unilateral guarantees to
          Poland<br>
          similar to those of Britain as a trap to get them into a war
          with<br>
          Germany in which Britain would do little or nothing or even
          give aid<br>
          to Germany. That this last possibility was not completely
          beyond<br>
          reality is clear from the fact that Britain did prepare an<br>
          expeditionary force to attack Russia in March 1940 when
          Britain was<br>
          technically at war with Germany but was doing nothing to fight
          her.<br>
          Russia offered the guarantee if it were extended to all states
          on<br>
          their western frontier including Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
          Lithuania,<br>
          Poland and Romania. This offer meant that Russia was
          guaranteeing its<br>
          renunciation of all the territory in these six states which it
          had<br>
          lost to them since 1917.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of accepting the offer, the British began to quibble.<br>
          They refused to guarantee the Baltic States on the ground that
          these<br>
          states did not want to be guaranteed although they had
          guaranteed<br>
          Poland on March 31st when Jozef Beck did not want it and had
          just<br>
          asked the Soviet Union to guarantee Poland and Romania,
          neither of<br>
          whom wanted a Soviet guarantee. When the Russians insisted,
          the<br>
          British countered by insisting that Greece, Turkey, Holland,
          Belgium,<br>
          and Switzerland must also be guaranteed.<br>

          France and Russia were both pushing Britain to form a Triple<br>
          &nbsp;(68 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          Alliance but Britain was reluctant and delayed the discussions
          to the<br>
          great irritation of the Soviet leaders. To show its
          displeasure, the<br>
          Soviet Union on May 3rd replaced Litvinov with Molotov as
          foreign<br>
          minister. This would have been a warning, Litvinov knew the
          West and<br>
          was favorable to democracy and to the Western Powers. As a
          Jew, he was<br>
          anti-Hitler. Molotov was a contrast from every point of view.<br>
          On May 19th, Chamberlain refused an alliance and pointed with<br>
          satisfaction to "that great virile nation on the borders of
          Germany<br>
          which under this agreement (of April 6th) is bound to give us
          all the<br>
          aid and assistance it can." He was talking about Poland!<br>

          The members of the military mission took a slow ship (speed<br>
          thirteen knots) and did not reach Moscow until August 11th.
          They were<br>
          again negotiators of second rank. In London, according to<br>
          rumor, neither side wanted an agreement. Considering
          Chamberlain's<br>
          secret efforts to make a settlement with Germany, there is no
          reason<br>
          to believe that he wanted an agreement with Russia.<br>
          The Russians demanded an exact military commitment as to what<br>
          forces would be used against Germany; they wanted guarantees
          whether<br>
          the states concerned accepted or not; they wanted specific
          permission<br>
          to fight across a territory such as Poland. These demands were
          flatly<br>
          rejected by Poland on August 19th. On the same day, Russia
          signed a<br>
          commercial treaty with Germany. Two days later, France ordered
          its<br>
          negotiators to sign the right to cross Poland but Russia
          refused to<br>
          accept this until Poland consented as well.<br>
          <br>
          Page 657<br>
          <br>
          On Aug. 23, Ribbentrop and Molotov signed an agreement which<br>
          provided that neither signer would take any aggressive action
          against<br>
          the other signer or give any support to a third Power in such
          action.<br>
          The secret protocol delimited spheres of interest in eastern
          Europe.<br>
          The line followed the northern boundary of Lithuania and the
          Narew,<br>
          Vistula, and San rivers in Poland and Germany gave Russia a
          free hand<br>
          in Bessarabia. This agreement was greeted as a stunning
          surprise in<br>
          the Entente countries. There was no reason why it should have
          been.<br>
          The British begged the Poles and the Germans to negotiate; the<br>
          Italians tried to arrange another four-Power conference;
          various<br>
          outsiders issued public and private appeals for peace; secret<br>
          emissaries flew back and forth between London and Germany.<br>
          All this was in vain because Hitler was determined on war and<br>
          his attention was devoted to manufacturing incidents to
          justify his<br>
          approaching attack. Political prisoners were taken from
          concentration<br>
          camps, dressed in German uniforms, and killed on the Polish
          frontier<br>
          as "evidence" of Polish aggression. A fraudulent ultimatum
          with<br>
          sixteen superficially reasonable demands on Poland was
          presented to<br>
          the British ambassador when the time limit had elapsed. It was
          not<br>
          presented to the Poles because the Polish ambassador in Berlin
          had<br>
          been ordered by Beck not to accept any document from the
          Germans.<br>

          The German invasion of Poland at 4:45a.m. on September 1,
          1939,<br>
          did not end the negotiations to make peace, nor did the
          complete<br>
          collapse of Polish resistance on September 16. Since these
          efforts<br>
          were futile, little need be said of them except that France
          and<br>
          Britain did not declare war on Germany until more than two
          days had<br>
          elapsed. During this time, no ultimatums were sent to Germany.
          On<br>
          September 3 at 9a.m., Britain presented an ultimatum which
          expired at<br>
          11a.m. In a similar fashion, France entered the war at 6p.m.

          <br>
          The Second World War lasted exactly six years. It was fought
          on<br>
          &nbsp;(69 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          every continent and on every sea. Deaths of civilians exceeded
          deaths<br>
          of combatants and many of both were killed without any
          military<br>
          justification as victims of sheer brutality, largely through
          coldblooded<br>
          savagery by Germans, and to a lesser extent by Japanese and<br>
          Russians, although British and American attacks from the air
          on<br>
          civilian populations and on non-military targets contributed
          to the<br>
          total. The distinctions between civilians and military
          personnel and<br>
          between neutrals and combatants which had been blurred in the
          First<br>
          World War were almost completely lost in the second. Civilians
          killed<br>
          reached 17 millions.<br>
          <br>
          The armies had no new weapons which had not been possessed in<br>
          1918 but the proportions of these and the ways in which they<br>
          cooperated with one another had been greatly modified.<br>
          <br>
          Page 662<br>
          <br>
          The chief reason the Germans had sufficient military resources<br>
          was not based, as is so often believed, on the fact that
          Germany was<br>
          highly mobilized for war, but on other factors. In the first
          place,<br>
          Hitler's economic revolution in Germany had reduced financial<br>
          considerations to a point where they played no role in
          economic or<br>
          political decisions. When decisions were made, on other
          grounds, money<br>
          was provided through completely unorthodox methods of finance,
          to<br>
          carry them out. In France and England, on the other hand,
          orthodox<br>
          financial principles, especially balanced budgets and stable
          exchange<br>
          rates, played a major role in all decisions and was one of the
          chief<br>
          reasons why these countries did not mobilize or why, having
          mobilized,<br>
          they had totally inadequate numbers of airplanes, tanks, etc.<br>

          Strategic bombing used long-range planes against industrial<br>
          targets and other civilian objectives. The upholders of
          strategic<br>
          bombing received little encouragement in Germany, in Russia,
          or even<br>
          in France.<br>

          THE BATTLE OF POLAND, SEPTEMBER 1939<br>
          <br>
          Page 667<br>
          <br>
          Although Britain and France declared war on Germany on
          September<br>
          3rd 1939, it cannot be said that they made war during the next
          two<br>
          weeks in which fighting raged in Poland. British airplanes
          roamed over<br>
          Germany, dropping leaflets for propaganda purposes but no
          support was<br>
          given to Poland. No attack was made by France and strict
          orders were<br>
          issued to the British Air Force not to bomb any German land
          forces<br>
          until April 1940. Similar orders to the Luftwaffe by Hitler
          were<br>
          maintained for part of this same period. When some British
          Members of<br>
          Parliament put pressure to drop bombs on German munition
          stores in the<br>
          Black Forest, Sir Kingsley Wood rejected the suggestion
          declaring:<br>
          "Are you aware it is private property? Why, you will be asking
          me to<br>
          bomb Essen next." Essen was the home of Krupp Munitions
          factories.<br>
          Blockade of Germany was established in such a perfunctory
          fashion<br>
          that large quantities of French iron ore continued to go to
          Germany<br>
          through the neutral Low Countries in return for German coal
          coming by<br>
          the same route. Hitler issued orders to his air force not to
          cross the<br>
          Western frontier except for reconnaissance, to his navy not to
          fight<br>
          the French, and to his submarines not to molest passenger
          vessels and<br>
          to treat unarmed merchant ships according to established rules
          of<br>
          international prize law. In open disobedience of these orders,
          a<br>
          German submarine sank the liner Athenia on September 3rd.<br>
          The Soviet Union was invited by Hitler to invade Poland from
          the<br>
          east and occupy the areas which had been granted to it in the
          Soviet-<br>
          German agreement of August 23rd. The Russians were afraid the
          Western<br>
          Powers might declare war on Russia in support of their
          guarantee to<br>
          Poland.<br>
          <br>
          When the Polish government moved to Romania, the Soviet Union<br>
          felt that it could not be accused of aggression against Poland
          if no<br>
          &nbsp;(70 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          Polish state still existed on Polish soil and justified their
          advance<br>
          with the excuse that they must restore order. On September 28,
          the<br>
          divided Poland between them.<br>

          THE SITZKRIEG, September 1939 - May 1940<br>
          <br>
          Page 668<br>
          <br>
          The period from the end of the Polish campaign to the German<br>
          attack on Denmark and Norway on April 9, 1940 is frequently
          called the<br>
          Sitzkrieg (sitting war) or even "phony war" because Western
          powers<br>
          made no real effort to fight Germany, eager to use the slow
          process of<br>
          economic blockade.<br>
          <br>
          Early in October, Hitler made a tentative offer to negotiate<br>
          peace with the Western Powers on the grounds that the cause of<br>
          fighting for Poland no longer existed. This offer was rejected
          by the<br>
          Western Powers with the public declaration that they were
          determined<br>
          to destroy Hitler's regime. This meant that war must continue.
          The<br>
          British and French answers were not based on a desire to
          continue war<br>
          but more on the belief that Hitler's rule in Germany was
          insecure and<br>
          that the best way to reach peace would be to encourage some
          anti-<br>
          Hitler movement within Germany itself.<br>
          <br>
          Page 669<br>
          <br>
          Germany was vulnerable to a blockade but there was no real
          effort<br>
          toward economic mobilization by Germany before 1943. Contrary
          to<br>
          general opinion, Germany was neither armed to the teeth nor
          fully<br>
          mobilized in this period. In each of the four years 1939-1942,<br>
          Britain's production of tanks, self-propelled guns, and planes
          was<br>
          higher tan Germany's. As late as September 1941, Hitler issued
          an<br>
          order for substantial reduction in armaments production. In
          1944, only<br>
          33% of Germany's output went for direct war purposes compared
          to 40%<br>
          in the U.S. and almost 45% in Britain.<br>
          <br>
          Page 671<br>
          <br>
          In order to reduce the enemy's ability to buy abroad,
          financial<br>
          connections were cut, his funds abroad were frozen, and his
          exports<br>
          were blocked. The U.S. cooperated as well, freezing the
          financial<br>
          assets of various nations as they were conquered by the
          aggressor<br>
          Powers and finally the assets of the aggressors themselves in
          June<br>
          1941.<br>
          <br>
          At the same time, pre-emptive buying of vital commodities at<br>
          their source to prevent Germany and its allies from obtaining
          them<br>
          began. Because of limited British funds, most of this task of<br>
          pre-emptive buying was taken over by the U.S., almost
          completely by<br>
          Feb. 1941.<br>
          <br>
          The blockade was enforced by Britain with little regard for<br>
          international law or for neutral rights there was relatively
          test from<br>
          the neutrals. The U.S. openly favored Britain while Italy and
          Japan<br>
          equally openly favored Germany. On the whole, the blockade had
          no<br>
          decisive effect on Germany's ability to wage war until 1945.
          Germany's<br>
          food supply was at the pre-war level until the very last
          months of the<br>
          war by starving the enslaved peoples of Poland,
          Czechoslovakia, Russia<br>
          and other countries.<br>

          During the "phony war" there were persons in Britain, France
          and<br>
          Germany who were eager to make war or peace. Such persons
          engaged in<br>
          extensive intrigues in order to negotiate peace or to prevent
          it.<br>
          There were a number of unsuccessful efforts to make peace
          between the<br>
          Western Powers and Germany in the six months following the
          defeat of<br>
          Poland.<br>

          Hitler had no political ambition with respect to the Balkans
          or<br>
          the Soviet Union. From both he wanted nothing more than the
          maximum<br>
          supply of raw materials and a political peace which would
          permit these<br>

          It is not yet clear why Finland rejected the Russian demands
          of<br>
          October 1939. The Germans and Russians believed that it was
          done under<br>
          British influence. For some unexplained reason the Finns seem
          to have<br>
          felt that the Russians would not attack their country but the
          Soviets<br>
          attacked at several points November 29th.<br>
          <br>
          Page 680<br>
          <br>
          In early 1939, the Anglo-French leaders now prepared to attack<br>
          the Soviet Union both from Finland and from Syria. On February
          5,<br>
          1940, the Supreme War Council decided to send to Finland an<br>
          expeditionary force of 100,000 heavily armed troops to fight
          the<br>
          Soviet hordes. Germany at once warned Norway and Sweden that
          it would<br>
          take action against them if the two Scandinavian countries
          permitted<br>
          passage of this force. Germany feared the Anglo-French forces
          would be<br>
          able to stop shipments of Swedish iron ore across Norway to
          Germany.<br>
          The evidence supports these fears because the high quality of
          Swedish<br>
          iron ore was essential to the German steel industry. As early
          as<br>
          September 1939, the British were discussing a project to
          interrupt the<br>
          Swedish shipments either by an invasion of Norway of by mining<br>
          Norwegian territorial waters. When Germany heard of the
          Anglo-French<br>
          expeditionary force, it began to prepare its own plans to
          seize Norway<br>
          first.<br>

          Hitler was so convinced that Britain would also make peace
          that<br>
          he gave lenient terms to France. France did not give up any
          overseas<br>
          territories or any ports on the Mediterranean, no naval
          vessels or any<br>
          airplanes or armaments. Northern France and all the western
          coast to<br>
          the Pyrenees came under occupation but the rest was left
          unoccupied,<br>
          ruled by a government free from direct German control.<br>

          Operation Barbarossa was based on the consideration that only
          by<br>
          destroying Russia and all Britain's hopes based on Russia
          could<br>
          Britain be forced to ask for peace.<br>

          Page 707<br>
          <br>
          In buying supplies, chiefly from the U.S., Britain had used
          up,<br>
          by June 1941, almost two-thirds of its dollars assets, gold
          stocks,<br>
          and marketable U.S. certificates.<br>
          <br>
          When the war began, American public opinion was united in its<br>
          determination to stay out. The isolationist reaction following<br>
          American intervention in the First World War had become
          stronger in<br>
          the 1930s. Historian were writing extensively to show that
          Germany had<br>
          not been solely guilty of beginning the war in 1914 and that
          the<br>
          Entente Powers had made more than their share of secret
          treaties<br>
          seeking selfish territorialism, both before the war and during
          the<br>
          fighting.<br>
          <br>
          In 1934, a committee of the U.S. Senate investigated the role<br>
          played by foreign loans and munition sales to belligerents in
          getting<br>
          the U.S. involved in World War I. Through the carelessness of
          the<br>
          Roosevelt administration, this committee fell under the
          control of<br>
          isolationists led by Republican Senator Gerald Nye. As a
          result, the<br>
          evidence was mobilized to show that American intervention in
          WWI had<br>
          been pushed by bankers and munitions manufacturers ("merchants
          of<br>
          death") to protect their profits and their interests in an
          Entente<br>
          victory. American public opinion had the uncomfortable feeling
          that<br>
          American youths had been sent to die for selfish purposes
          concealed<br>
          behind propaganda slogans about "the rights of small nations,"<br>
          "freedom of the seas," or "making the world safe for
          democracy." All<br>

          <br>
          this created a widespread determination to keep out of
          Europe's<br>
          constant quarrels and avoid what was regarded as the "error of
          1917."<br>
          <br>
          Page 708<br>
          <br>
          The isolationist point of view had been enacted into the
          socalled<br>
          Neutrality Act curtailing loans and munitions sales to<br>
          belligerent countries. Materials had to be sold on a "cash and
          carry"<br>
          basis and had to be transported on foreign ships. Also, loans
          to<br>
          belligerents were forbidden.<br>
          These laws gave a great advantage to a state like Italy which
          had<br>
          ships to carry supplies from the U.S. or which had cash to buy
          them<br>
          here in contrast to a country like Ethiopia which had no ships
          and<br>
          little cash.<br>

          Roosevelt called a special session of Congress to revise the<br>
          neutrality laws so that the Entente powers could obtain
          supplies in<br>
          the U.S. The embargo on munitions was repealed. American ships
          were<br>
          not to be armed, to carry munitions, or to go to any areas the<br>
          President had proclaimed as combat zones.<br>
          The extremes ranged from the advocates of immediate
          intervention<br>
          into the war on the side of Britain to the defenders of
          extreme<br>
          isolation. Most American opinion was somewhere between the two<br>
          extremes.<br>
          <br>
          In order to unify America's political front, Roosevelt took
          two<br>
          interventionists into his cabinet as Secretaries of War and
          the Navy.<br>
          Roosevelt himself was sympathetic to this point of view.<br>
          <br>
          Page 710<br>
          <br>
          Wendell Wilkie assured the American people that Roosevelt's
          reelection<br>
          in 1940 meant that "we will be at war." Roosevelt replied<br>
          with assurances that "We will not sent our army, navy, or air
          forces<br>
          to fight in foreign lands except in case of attack. Your boys
          are not<br>
          going to be sent into any foreign wars." This campaign oratory
          was<br>
          based on the general recognition that the overwhelming
          majority were<br>
          determined to stay out of war.<br>
          <br>
          Page 711<br>
          <br>
          Strategic plans were drawn up deciding that Germany was the
          major<br>
          danger, with Japan of secondary importance, and that every
          effort,<br>
          including actual warfare, should be used. Germany's
          declaration of war<br>
          on the U.S. four days after Pearl Harbor saved the U.S. from
          the need<br>
          to attempt something which American public opinion would have
          never<br>
          condoned, an attack on Germany after we had been attacked by
          Japan.<br>
          <br>

          Roosevelt improvised a policy which consisted in almost equal<br>
          measure of propagandist public statements, tactical
          subterfuges, and<br>
          hesitant half-steps. In September 1940, Roosevelt gave fifty
          old WWI<br>
          destroyers to Britain in return for 99 year leases of naval
          and air<br>
          bases in this hemisphere.<br>
          <br>
          Page 715<br>
          <br>
          Loans were forbidden by the Neutrality Act. To Roosevelt, it<br>
          seemed foolish to allow monetary considerations to stand as an<br>
          obstacle in the way of self-defence (as he regarded the
          survival of<br>
          Great Britain).<br>
          <br>
          Page 716<br>
          <br>
          Opponents argued that Britain had tens of billions in
          concealed<br>
          assets and that Lend-Lease was merely a clever trick for
          foisting the<br>
          costs of Britain's war onto the backs of American tax-payers.
          Still<br>
          others insisted that Lend-Lease was an unneutral act which
          would<br>
          arouse German rage and eventually involved the American people
          in a<br>
          war they had no need to get in. The bill passed and provided
          that the<br>
          president could "sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease,
          lend, or<br>
          dispose of any defence article" to any nation whose defence he
          found<br>
          vital to the defence of the U.S.<br>

          <br>
          Behind this whole effort toward economic mobilization was a<br>
          secret decision of Roosevelt's military advisers in 1941 that
          the war<br>
          could not be won unless the U.S. planned eventually to raise
          the<br>
          number of men in its armed forces to eight million. At once,<br>
          isolationists were in full cry and an ACt extending
          selective-service<br>
          training passed 203-202.<br>

          The British had no plans for an invasion of Europe and hoped
          that<br>
          Germany could be worn down by blockade. No one pointed out
          that a<br>
          Germany defeat by British methods would leave the Soviet
          armies<br>
          supreme in all Europe with no forces to oppose them.<br>

          At the same time he gave Britain ten coast-guard cutters,<br>
          Roosevelt seized possession of 65 Axis and Danish ships in
          American<br>
          harbors. The financial assets of the Axis Powers were frozen.
          American<br>
          flying schools were made available to train British aviators.
          By<br>
          presidential proclamation, the American Neutrality Zone was
          extended<br>
          to Iceland. The U.S. navy was ordered to follow all Axis
          raiders or<br>
          submarines west of this meridian broadcasting their positions
          to the<br>
          British.<br>

          American naval escort of British convoys could not fail to
          lead<br>
          to a "shooting war" with Germany. The Roosevelt administration
          did not<br>
          shrink from this possibility. Fortunately for the
          Administration's<br>
          plans, Hitler played right into its hands by declaring war on
          the<br>
          U.S. By that date, incidents were becoming more frequent.<br>
          On Oct. 17, the U.S. destroyer Kearney was torpedoed; two
          weeks<br>
          later, the destroyer Rueben James was blown to pieces. On Nov.
          10, an<br>
          American escort of 11 vessels picked up a convoy of six
          vessels<br>
          including America's three largest ocean liners with 20,000
          British<br>
          troops and guarded them from Halifax to India and Singapore.<br>
          Many of the activities of the American Navy in the summer of
          1941<br>
          were known not at all or were known only very imperfectly to
          they<br>
          American public but it would seem that public opinion
          generally<br>
          supported the Administration's actions. In September,
          Roosevelt sought<br>
          to repeal the Neutrality Act forbidding the arming of merchant
          vessels<br>
          which was done on Oct. 17. Two weeks later, all the essential
          points<br>
          of the Neutrality Act were repealed. This meant that open
          warfare with<br>
          Germany was in the immediate future.<br>

          <br>
          Large numbers of anti-Stalinist Russians began to surrender to<br>
          the Nazis. Most of these were Ukranians and eager to fight
          with the<br>
          Nazis against the Stalinist regime. Anti-Stalinist deserters
          serving<br>
          in the Nazi forces reached 900,000 in June 1944 under Soviet
          general<br>
          A. A. Vlasov. At the end of the war, hundreds of thousands of
          Vlasov's<br>
          supporters fled westward to the American and British armies
          for refuge<br>
          from Stalin's vengeance but were handed over to the Soviet
          Union to be<br>
          murdered out of and or sent to slave-labor camps in Siberia.
          The<br>
          dimensions of the human suffering involved in this whole
          situation is<br>
          beyond the human imagination.<br>

          <br>
          Japanese aggressions of 1941 which culminated in the attack on<br>
          Pearl Harbor were based on fear and weakness and not on
          arrogance and<br>
          strength.<br>
          <br>
          By 1939, the Japanese economy was beginning to totter under
          the<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(74 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          growing restrictions on Japanese trade imposed by Western
          countries<br>
          and acute material shortages. Problems such as these might
          have driven<br>
          many nations, even the West, to desperate action.<br>
          <br>
          The world depression made it very difficult to increase
          Japanese<br>
          exports. The excessively high American tariff, although no so<br>
          intended, seemed to the Japanese to be an aggressive
          restriction<br>
          on their ability to live. The "imperial preference"
          regulations of the<br>
          British Commonwealth had a similar consequence. Since Japan
          could not<br>
          defend itself against such economic measures, it resorted to
          political<br>
          measures and the Western Powers would inevitably defend
          themselves<br>
          with even greater economic restrictions driving Japan to open
          war.<br>
          <br>
          Page 735<br>
          <br>
          The American government began to tighten the economic pincers
          on<br>
          Japan just as Japan was seeking to tighten its military
          pincers on<br>
          China. Japan was able to close all routes to China. The
          American<br>
          government retaliated with economic warfare. In 1938, it
          established a<br>
          "moral embargo" on the shipment of aircraft or their parts and
          bombs<br>
          to Japan. In 1939, large U.S. and British loans to China
          sought to<br>
          strengthen its collapsing financial system and Washington gave<br>
          notice to cancel the 1911 commercial treaty with Japan opening
          the<br>
          door to all kinds of economic pressure. The "moral embargo"
          was<br>
          extended to cover light metals and all machinery or plans for
          making<br>
          aviation gasoline.<br>
          <br>
          Such a policy was opposed by isolationists insisting such<br>
          economic sanctions could only be enforced, in the long run, by
          war. If<br>
          Japan could not get petroleum, bauxite, rubber and tin by
          trade, it<br>
          could be prevented from seizing these areas producing these
          products<br>
          only by force. To avoid this obvious inference,l Cordell Hull
          sought<br>
          to make America's economic policy ambiguous so that Japan
          might be<br>
          deterred by fear of sanctions not yet imposed and won by hopes
          of<br>
          concessions not yet granted. Such a policy was a mistake but
          it<br>
          obtained Roosevelt's explicit approval since it allowed more<br>
          aggressive elements of Japanese to take control and any
          drastic action<br>
          seeking to end the strain became welcome.<br>
          <br>
          Page 736<br>
          <br>
          The ambiguity of American commercial policy slowly resolved in<br>
          the direction of increasing economic sanctions. There was a
          steady<br>
          increase in America's economic pressure by the growth of
          financial<br>
          obstacles and by increasing purchasing difficulties.<br>
          From Hull's doctrinaire refusal to encourage any Japanese hope<br>
          that they could win worthwhile American concessions, the
          advocates of<br>
          extremism gained influence.<br>
          <br>
          The President ordered the embargo of many goods which Japan<br>
          needed, including aluminum, airplane parts, all arms and
          munitions,<br>
          optical supplies, and various "strategic" materials but left
          petroleum<br>
          and scrap iron unhindered.<br>
          <br>
          Page 737<br>
          <br>
          American diplomatic pressure on Japan must be timed to avoid<br>
          pushing Japan into desperate action before American-German
          relations<br>
          had passed the breaking point.<br>
          <br>
          Page 739<br>
          <br>
          On July 26, 1941, the U.S. froze all Japanese financial assets
          in<br>
          the U.S. virtually ending trade between the two countries.
          Members of<br>
          the British Commonwealth issued similar orders. As a result of
          these<br>
          pressures, Japan found itself in a position where its oil
          reserves<br>
          would be exhausted in two years, its aluminum reserves in
          seven<br>
          months. The chief of the Navy told the emperor that if Japan
          resorted<br>
          to war, it would be very doubtful that it could win. It was
          also clear<br>
          that if war came, economic pressure was too damaging to allow
          Japan to<br>
          postpone such operations until 1942. The decision was made to<br>
          negotiate until late October. If an agreement could be
          reached, the<br>
          &nbsp;(75 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          preparations for war could be suspended, otherwise the
          negotiations<br>
          would be ended and the advance to open war continued. The
          Cabinet<br>
          sought desperately to reach an agreement in Washington.<br>
          <br>
          Page 741<br>
          <br>
          The Japanese misjudged American psychology. Nomura found it<br>
          impossible to reach an agreement because Hull's demands were
          extreme.<br>
          The Americans had broken the secret Japanese codes and knew
          that war<br>
          would begin if Nomura failed to obtain relaxation of the
          economic<br>
          embargo. They did not however have the plans for the attack on
          Pearl<br>
          Harbor.<br>
          <br>
          Page 742<br>
          <br>
          On November 27th, a war warning was sent from Washington to
          Pearl<br>
          Harbor but no increased precautions were made. On December 7,
          an army<br>
          enlisted man, using radar, detected a group of strange planes<br>
          coming down from the north 132 miles away but his report was<br>
          disregarded. The American losses included 2,400 killed, 1,200
          injured.<br>
          Japanese losses amounted to a couple of dozen planes.<br>

          At Casablanca, the political decision of Roosevelt and
          Churchill<br>
          on unconditional surrender was published with great fanfare,
          and at<br>
          once initiated a controversy which still continues based on
          the belief<br>
          that it had an adverse influence by discouraging any hopes
          within Axis<br>
          countries that they could find a way out by slackening their
          efforts,<br>
          by revolting against their governments, or by negotiations
          seeking<br>
          some kind of of "conditional" surrender. There seems little
          doubt that<br>
          it solidified our enemies and prolonged their resistance where<br>
          opposition to the war was widespread and active.<br>

          In May 1943, Sicily was overrun and in September,Italy<br>
          surrendered and the German armies were pushed backward from
          eastern<br>
          Europe. Major decisions were made in 1943 which played a major
          role in<br>
          determining the nature of the postwar world.<br>

          Although Soviet demands were clearly in conflict with the high<br>
          purposes of the Atlantic charter, Churchill was not averse to<br>
          accepting them on the grounds of physical necessity but
          American<br>
          objections to discussions of territorial questions while the
          war was<br>
          still going on forced him to refuse Stalin's requests. The
          British<br>
          found themselves between the high and proclaimed principles of
          the<br>
          Americans and the low and secret interests of the Russians.<br>
          At the American centers of power, there was complete
          conviction<br>
          in the value of unrestricted aid to Russia. These aims were
          embraced<br>
          by men like Harry Hopkins, General Marshall, and Roosevelt
          himself.<br>

          The Americans decided to choke off the Italian offensive in
          order<br>
          to concentrate on the cross-channel attack. The attack on
          North Africa<br>
          was a substitute for an attack on Germany from Italy.<br>

          Once ashore, the Sicilian campaign was ineptly carried on
          because<br>
          occupation of territory was given precedence over destruction
          of the<br>
          enemy. No efforts were made to close the Straits of Messina so
          the<br>
          Germans were able to send almost two divisions as
          reinforcements from<br>
          Italy and later, when the island had to be abandoned, they
          were<br>
          equally free to evacuate it in seven days without the loss a
          man.<br>

          The history of Italy in 1943 is a history of lost
          opportunities.<br>
          Italy might have got out in the summer and the Germans might
          have been<br>
          ejected shortly afterward. Instead, Italy was torn to pieces
          and got<br>
          out of the war so slowly that Germans were still fighting on

          soil at the final surrender in 1945.<br>
          <br>
          These great misfortunes were the result of a number of forces:<br>
          <br>
          1) weakness of Italy relative to Germany;<br>
          2) weakness of Allies after diversion of power to Britain;<br>
          3) mistrust of Italians by Allies;<br>
          4) the inflexible Allied insistence on unconditional surrender
          which<br>
          left the Italians helpless to resist the Germans.<br>
          <br>
          Page 764<br>
          <br>
          When the Italian government offered the join the Allies in<br>
          fighting the Germans, they insisted that the publication of
          the<br>
          armistice and a tentative paratrooper drop in Rome be put off
          until<br>
          sufficient Allied forces were within striking distance to
          protect the<br>
          city from the German troops nearby. Eisenhower refused and
          published<br>
          the Italian surrender one day before the American Army landed
          at<br>
          Salerno. The Germans reacted to the news of the Italian
          "betrayal"<br>
          with characteristic speed. Available forces converged on the
          Salerno<br>
          beachhead, an armored division fought its way into Rome,
          Italian<br>
          troops were disarmed everywhere, and the Italian government
          had to<br>
          flee. Numerous vessels were sunk by the Germans.<br>
          <br>
          Page 765<br>
          <br>
          As Allied forces slowly recovered Italian territory from the<br>
          tenacious grasp of the Germans, the royal government remained<br>
          subservient to its conquerors. Civilian affairs were
          completely in<br>
          military hands under and organization known as Allied Military<br>
          Government of Occupied Territories. The creation of these<br>
          organizations on a purely Anglo-American basis,to rule the
          first Axis<br>
          territory to be "liberated" became a very important precedent
          for<br>
          Soviet behavior wen their armies began to occupy enemy
          territory in<br>
          eastern Europe who were able to argue that they could exclude<br>
          Anglo-Americans from active participation in military
          government in<br>
          the east since they had earlier been excluded in the west.<br>
          While these political events were taking place, the military<br>
          advance was moving like a snail. The Allied invasion of Italy
          was<br>
          given very limited resources for a very large task.. It was
          only under<br>
          such limitations of resources, explicitly stated, that the
          Americans<br>
          accepted the British suggestion for an invasion of Italy at
          all.<br>
          <br>
          Page 767<br>
          <br>
          It was suggested that German success in holding the Rapido was<br>
          due to the accuracy of their artillery fire and that this was
          was<br>
          being spotted from the ancient monastery founded by St.
          Benedict in<br>
          529 A.D. on the top of Monte Cassino. It was further suggested
          that<br>
          General Clark should have obliterated the monastery with
          aerial<br>
          bombardment but had failed to do so because he was a Roman
          Catholic.<br>
          After Feb. 15, 1944, General Clark did destroy the site
          completely<br>
          without helping the situation a bit. We now know that the
          Germans had<br>
          not been using the monastery; but once it was destroyed by us,
          they<br>
          dug into the rubble to make a stronger defence.<br>
          On May 16th, a Polish Division captured Monte Cassino.<br>

          Page 770<br>
          <br>
          Efforts to create a new Polish army were hampered by the fact<br>
          that about 10,000 POlish officers along with 5,000
          intellectuals and<br>
          professional persons, all of whom had been held in three camps
          in<br>
          western Russia, could not be found. At least 100,000 Polish
          prisoners<br>
          of war, out of 320,000 captured in 1939, had been
          exterminated.<br>
          The German radio suddenly announced on April 13, 1943, that<br>
          German forces in occupied Russia had discovered, at Katyn,
          near<br>
          Smolensk, Russia, mass graves containing the bodies of 5,000
          Polish<br>
          officers who had been murdered by the Soviet authorities in
          1940.<br>
          Moscow called this a Nazi propaganda trick and declared that
          the<br>
          Polish officers had been murdered and buried by the Nazis
          themselves<br>
          when they captured the officers and this Soviet territory.<br>

          The strategic decision of September 1943 to reject Churchill's<br>
          plans for a Balkan campaign in order to concentrate on a
          cross-Channel<br>
          offensive in 1944 were of vital importance in setting the form
          that<br>
          postwar Europe would take. If it had been decided to postpone
          the<br>
          cross-Channel attack and concentrate on an assault from the
          Aegean<br>
          across Bulgaria and Romania toward Poland and Slovakia, the
          postwar<br>
          situation would have been quite different.<br>
          <br>
          It has been argued that failure to reach agreement on the<br>
          territorial settlement of eastern Europe while the war was
          still in<br>
          progress meant that Soviet armies would undoubtedly dominate
          once<br>
          Germany was defeated. This assumption implies that America
          should have<br>
          threatened to reduce of to cut off Lend-Lease supplies going
          unless<br>
          we could obtain Soviet agreement to the kind of eastern
          European<br>
          settlement we wanted.<br>

          The Soviet advance became a race with the Western Powers even<br>
          though Eisenhower's orders held back their advance at many
          points<br>
          (such as Prague) to allow the Russians to occupy areas the
          Americans<br>
          could easily have taken first.<br>

          Roosevelt's sense of the realities of power were quite as
          acute<br>
          as Churchill's or Stalin's but he concealed that sense much
          more<br>
          deliberately and much more completely under a screen of
          high-sounding<br>
          moral principles.<br>

          Polish ministers rushed from London to Moscow to negotiate.
          While<br>
          they were still talking and when the Soviet army was only six
          miles<br>
          from Warsaw, the Polish underground forces in the city, at a
          Soviet<br>
          invitation, rose up against the Germans. A force of 40,000
          responded<br>
          to the suggestion but the Russian armies stopped their advance
          and<br>
          obstructed supplies to the rebels in spite of appeals from all
          parts<br>
          of the world. After sixty-three days of hopeless fighting, the
          Polish<br>
          Home Army had to surrender to the Germans. This Soviet
          treachery<br>
          removed their chief obstacle to Communist rule in Poland and
          the<br>
          London government in London was accordingly ignored.<br>

          When victorious armies broke into Germany, late in 1944, the<br>
          Nazis were still holding the survivors of 8 million enslaved
          workers,<br>
          10 million Jews, 6 million Russian prisoners of war and
          millions of<br>
          prisoners from other armies. Over half of the Jews and
          Russians,<br>
          possibly 12 million, were killed before final victory in 1945.<br>

          The ideas that strategic air attacks must be directed at<br>
          civilians in enemy cities were almost wholly ignored in the
          Soviet<br>
          Union, largely rejected in Germany, created great controversy
          in<br>
          France, but were accepted to a large extent among airmen in
          Britain<br>
          and the U.S.<br>
          <br>

          The contribution by strategic bombing to the defeat of Germany<br>
          was relatively incidental, in spite of the terrible losses
          suffered in<br>
          the effort. The shift to city bombing was more or less
          accidental. In<br>
          spite of the erroneous ideas of Chamberlain, Baldwin,
          Churchill, the<br>
          war opened and continued for months with no city bombing at
          all, for<br>
          the simple reason that the Germans had no intentions, no
          planes, and<br>
          no equipment for strategic bombing.<br>
          <br>
          The attack on cities began by accident when a group of German<br>
          planes which were lost dumped their bomb loads, contrary to
          orders, on<br>
          London on August 1940. The RAF retaliated by bombing Berlin
          the next<br>
          night. Goring in counter-retaliation. British efforts to
          counterattack<br>
          &nbsp;(78 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          by daylight raids on military objectives resulted in such
          losses that<br>
          the air offensive was shifted to night attacks. This entailed
          a shift<br>
          from industrial targets to indiscriminate bombing of urban
          areas. This<br>
          was justified with the wholly mistaken argument that civilian
          morale<br>
          was a German weak point and that the destruction of workers'
          housing<br>
          would break this morale. The evidence shows that the German
          war effort<br>
          was not weakened in any way by lowering civilian morale in
          spite of<br>
          the horrors heaped on it.<br>
          <br>
          Page 802<br>
          <br>
          The most extraordinary example of this suffering occurred in
          the<br>
          British fire raids on Hamburg in 1943 which was attacked for
          more than<br>
          a week with a mixture of high-explosive and incendiary bombs
          so<br>
          persistently that fire-storms appeared. The air in the city
          heated to<br>
          over a thousand degrees began to rise rapidly with the result
          that<br>
          winds of hurricane force rushed into the city. The water
          supply was<br>
          destroyed and the flames were too hot for water to be
          effective. Final<br>
          figures for the destruction were set at 40,000 dead, 250,000
          houses<br>
          destroyed with over a million made homeless. This as the
          greatest<br>
          destruction by air attacks on a city until the fire raid on
          Tokyo on<br>
          March 9 1945 which still stands today as the most devastating
          air<br>
          attack in human history.<br>

          General Eisenhower ignored Berlin and drove directly eastward<br>
          toward Dresden. Eisenhower's decisions permitted the Soviet
          forces to<br>
          "liberate" all the capital cities of central Europe. As late
          as May<br>
          4th, when the American forces were sixty miles from Prague and
          the<br>
          Soviet armies more than a hundred, an effort by the former to
          advance<br>
          to the city was stopped at the request of the Soviet
          commander,<br>
          despite a vain message from Churchill to Eisenhower to take
          the Czech<br>
          capital for political bargaining purposes.<br>

          Soon the names Buchenwald, Dachau, and Belsen were repeated
          with<br>
          horror throughout the world. At Belsen, 35,000 dead bodies and
          30,000<br>
          still breathing were found. The world was surprised and
          shocked. There<br>
          was no reason for the world's press to be surprised at Nazi
          bestiality<br>
          in 1945 since the evidence had been fully available in 1938.<br>

          CLOSING IN ON JAPAN, 1943-1945<br>
          <br>
          When Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, Japan was already<br>

          Even American strategic bombing was different in the Pacific<br>
          using B-29s, unknown in Europe, for area bombing of civilians
          in<br>
          cities, something we disapproved in Europe.<br>
          <br>
          Page 815<br>
          <br>
          279 B-29s carrying 1,900 tons of fire bombs were sent on a
          lowlevel<br>
          attack on Tokyo. The result was the most devastating air
          attack<br>
          in all history. With the loss of only 3 planes, 16 square
          miles of<br>
          central Tokyo were burned out; 250,000 houses were destroyed,
          over a<br>
          million persons were made homeless and 84,793 were killed.
          This was<br>
          more destructive than the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima
          five months<br>
          later.<br>

          American leaders shuddered to think of the results if such<br>
          Kamikaze attacks were hurled at troop transports and American<br>
          estimates of casualties were over half a million. These
          considerations<br>
          form the background to the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and
          the<br>
          decision to use to atom bomb on Japan.<br>
          The nature and decisions taken at the conference of Roosevelt,<br>
          Churchill and Stalin held at Yalta in February 1945 has been
          so much<br>
          distorted by partisan propaganda that it is difficult for any<br>

          In China,90%of the railroads were out of operation. The
          dominant<br>
          Kuomintang Party's chief aim seemed to be to maintain its
          armed<br>
          blockade of the Communist forces operating out of Yenan in<br>
          northwestern China where the highly-disciplined Communist
          armies had<br>
          gained some degree of local support.<br>
          <br>
          American hopes of fusing the two parties into a common Chinese<br>
          government broke down on the refusals of the Kuomintang and
          the<br>
          remoteness of the Communists. In September 1944, Roosevelt
          suggest<br>
          that General Stillwell be given command of all Chinese forces
          fighting<br>
          the Japanese. General Chiang answered with a demand that
          Stilwell be<br>

          It is extremely likely that the frantic and otherwise<br>
          inexplicable haste to use the second and third bombs, 21 and
          24 days<br>
          after Alamagordo arose from the desire to force the Japanese

          On the economic side was a somewhat modified version of the<br>
          Morgenthau scheme (which had sought the complete ruralization
          of<br>
          German economic life to an agrarian basis) which was modified
          almost<br>
          at once by a number of factors.<br>
          <br>
          The first modifying factor was a desire for reparations. The<br>
          Americans insisted that reparations betaken from existing
          stocks and<br>
          plants rather than from future production in order to avoid
          the error<br>
          of the 1919-1933 period, the overbuilding of German capital
          equipment<br>
          and American financing of reparations into the indefinite
          future. It<br>
          was provided that all reparations come from Germany as a whole
          and be<br>
          credited to the victors on a percentage basis.<br>

          On August 10th, a message accepting the Potsdam terms was
          sent.<br>
          Thus ended six years of world war in which 70 million men had
          been<br>
          mobilized and 17 million killed in battle. At least 18 million<br>
          civilians had been killed. The Soviet Union had lost 6.1
          million<br>
          soldiers and 14 million wounded and over 10 million civilians
          dead.<br>
          Germany lost 6.6 million servicemen with 7.2 million wounded
          and 1.3<br>
          million missing. Japan had 1.9 million dead. Britain war dead
          were<br>
          357,000 and America's were 294,000.<br>
          <br>
          All this personal tragedy and material damage of untold
          billions<br>
          was needed to demonstrate that Germany could not establish and
          Nazi<br>
          continental bloc in Europe nor could Japan dominate an
          East-Asian co-<br>
          Prosperity Sphere. This is the chief function of war: to
          demonstrate<br>
          as conclusively as possible to mistaken minds that they are
          mistaken<br>
          in regard to power relationships. But as we shall see, war
          also<br>
          changes most drastically the objective facts themselves.<br>

          CHAPTER XVI: THE NEW AGE<br>
          <br>
          INTRODUCTION.<br>
          <br>
          Page 831<br>
          <br>
          World War II transformed a system where man's greatest
          problems<br>
          were the material ones of man's helplessness in the face of
          natural<br>
          threats of disease, starvation, and natural catastrophes to
          the<br>
          totally different system of the 1960s and 1970s where the
          greatest<br>
          threat to man is man himself and where his greatest problems
          are the<br>
          social (and non-material) ones of what his true goals of
          existence are<br>
          and what use he should make of his immense power of the
          universe, his<br>
          fellow men.<br>
          <br>
          For thousands of years, some men had viewed themselves as<br>
          creatures a little lower than angels, or even God, and a
          little higher<br>
          than the beasts. Now, in the 20th century, man has acquired
          almost<br>
          &nbsp;(80 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          divine powers and it has become increasingly clear that he can
          no<br>
          longer regard himself as an animal but must regard himself as
          at least<br>
          a man if not obligated to act like an angel or even a god.<br>
          <br>
          Page 832<br>
          <br>
          The whole trend of the 19th century had been to emphasize
          man's<br>
          animal nature and seek to increase his supply of material
          necessities.<br>
          <br>
          Page 833<br>
          <br>
          The great achievements of the 19th century and the great
          crisis<br>
          of the 20th century are both related to the Puritan tradition
          of the<br>
          17th century which regarded the body and the material as
          sinful and<br>
          dangerous and something which must be sternly controlled.<br>
          <br>
          Page 837<br>
          <br>
          These methods appeared in a number of ways, notably in an<br>
          emphasis on self-discipline for future benefits, on restricted<br>
          consumption and on saving in a devotion to work, and in a
          postponement<br>
          of enjoyment to a future which never arrived. A typical
          example might<br>
          be John D. Rockefeller: great saver, great worker, and great
          postponer<br>
          of any self-centered action, even death. To such people, the
          most<br>
          adverse comments which could be made about a failure to
          distinguish<br>
          from a "successful" man were that he was a "saltrel," a
          "loafer," a<br>
          "sensualist," and "self-indulgent." These terms reflected the
          value<br>
          that the middle classes placed on work, saving, self-denial
          and social<br>
          conformity.<br>
          <br>
          Page 838<br>
          <br>
          The nineteenth century's emphasis on acquisitive behavior, on<br>
          achievement, and on infinitely expansible demand is equally
          associated<br>
          with the middle-class outlook. These basic features are
          inevitably<br>
          lacking in backward, tribal, underdeveloped peasant societies
          and<br>
          groups, not only in Africa and Asia but also in much of the<br>
          Mediterranean, Latin America, central France, in the Mennonite<br>
          communities of Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The lack of future<br>
          preference and expansible material demands in other areas are<br>
          essential features of the 20th century crisis.<br>
          <br>
          George Sorel (Reflections on Violence, 1908) sought a solution
          to<br>
          this crisis in irrationalism, in action for its own sake. The
          other<br>
          tendency sought a solution in rationalization, science,
          universality,<br>
          cosmopolitanism and the continued pursuit of truth. The war
          became a<br>
          struggle between the forces of irrationality represented by
          Fascism<br>
          and the forces of Western science and rationalization
          represented by<br>
          the Allied nations.<br>
          <br>
          RATIONALIZATION AND SCIENCE<br>
          <br>
          Page 838<br>
          <br>
          Rationalization gradually spread into the more dominant
          problem<br>
          of business. From maximizing production, it shifted to
          maximizing<br>
          profits.<br>
          <br>
          The introduction of rationalization into war was attributed to<br>
          the efforts of Professor P.M.S. Blackett (Nobel Prize 1948) to
          apply<br>
          radar to antiaircraft guns. From there, Blackett took the
          technique<br>
          into antisubmarine defence whence it spread under the name<br>
          "Operational Research" (OP).<br>
          <br>
          Operational research, unlike science, made its greatest<br>
          contribution in regard to the use of existing equipment rather
          than<br>
          the effort to invent new equipment. It often game specific<br>
          recommendations, reached through techniques of mathematical<br>
          probability, which directly contradicted the established
          military<br>
          procedures. A simple case concerned the problem of air attack
          on enemy<br>
          submarines: For what depth should the bomb fuse be set? In
          1940, RAF<br>
          set its fuses at 100 feet. based on three factors:<br>
          <br>
          1) the time interval between the moments when the submarine
          sighted<br>
          the plane and the plane sighted the submarine;<br>
          2) the speed of approach of the plane; and<br>
          &nbsp;(81 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          3) the speed of submergence of the submarine.<br>
          <br>
          The submarine was unlikely to be sunk if the bomb exploded
          more<br>
          than 20 feet away. Operational Research added an additional
          factor:How<br>
          near was the bomber to judging the exact spot where the
          submarine went<br>
          down? since this error increased rapidly with the distance of
          the<br>
          original sighting, a submarine which had time to submerge
          deeply would<br>
          almost inevitably be missed by the bomb in position if not in
          depth;<br>
          but with 100 foot fuses, submarines which had little time to
          submerge<br>
          were missed because the fuse was too deep even when the
          position was<br>
          correct. OP recommended setting fuses at 25 feet to sink the
          near<br>
          sightings and practically conceded the escape of all distant<br>
          sightings. When fuses were set at 35 feet, successful attacks
          on<br>
          submarines increased 400 percent with the same equipment.<br>
          <br>
          Page 839<br>
          <br>
          The British applied OP to many similar problems.<br>
          <br>
          1) With an inadequate3 number of A.A. guns, is it better to<br>
          concentrate them to protect part of a city thoroughly or to
          disperse<br>
          them to protect all of the city inadequately? (The former is
          better)<br>
          2) Repainting night bombers from black to white when used on
          submarine<br>
          patrol increased sightings of submarines 30%.<br>
          3) Are small convoys safer for merchant ships than large ones
          (No by a<br>
          large margin.)<br>
          4) With an inadequate number of patrol planes, was it better
          to search<br>
          the whole patrol area some days (as was the practice) or to
          search<br>
          part of it ever day with whatever planes were available? (the
          latter<br>
          was better).<br>
          <br>
          OP calculated the number of people killed per ton of bombs<br>
          dropped showing that the casualties inflicted on Germany were
          about<br>
          400 civilians killed per month - about half the German
          automobile<br>
          accident death rate - while 200 RAF crewmen were killed per
          month in<br>
          doing the bombing. Later it was discovered the raids were
          actually<br>
          killing 200 German civilians contributing little to the war
          effort at<br>
          the cost of the 200 RAF men each month and thus were a
          contribution to<br>
          the German victory. These estimates made it advisable to shift
          planes<br>
          to U-boat patrol. A bomber in its average life of 30 missions,
          dropped<br>
          100 tons of bombs killing 20 Germans and destroying a few
          houses. The<br>
          same plane in 30 missions of submarine patrol saved 6 loaded
          merchant<br>
          ships and their crews from submarines. This discovery was
          violently<br>
          resisted by the head of the RAF, Sir Arthur (Bomber) Harris.<br>

          In 1938, Vannevar Bush, professor of electrical engineering
          and<br>
          vice-president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
          persuaded<br>
          Roosevelt to create the National Defence Research Committee
          with Bush<br>
          as Chairman. When money ran short, they obtained half from MIT
          and an<br>
          equal sum from John D. Rockefeller.<br>

          First news of the success of Operations Research in Britain
          was<br>
          brought to the U.S. by Conant in 1940 and was formally
          introduced by<br>
          Bush. With the arrival of peace, it became an established
          civilian<br>
          profession.<br>
          <br>
          The rationalizing of society used the tremendous advances in<br>
          mathematics of the 19th century but a good deal came from new<br>
          developments. Amlong these have been applications of game
          theory,<br>
          information theory, symbolic logic, cybernetics, and
          electronic<br>
          computing. The newest of these was probably game theory,
          worked out by<br>
          a Hungarian refugee mathematician, John von Neumann, at the
          Institute<br>
          for Advanced Study. This applied mathematical techniques to
          situations<br>
          in which persons sought conflicting goals in a nexus of
          relationships<br>
          governed by rules. The basic work was "Theory of Games and
          Economic<br>
          Behavior" by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (Princeton
          1944).<br>

          THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY PATTERN<br>
          <br>
          Page 862<br>
          <br>
          The decision to use the bomb against Japan marks one of the<br>
          turning points in history of our times. The scientists who
          were<br>
          consulted had no information on the status of the war itself,
          had no<br>
          idea how close to the end Japan already was. Some people like
          General<br>
          Groves wanted it to be used to justify the two billion they
          had spent.<br>
          After it was all over, Director of Military Intelligence for
          the<br>
          Pacific theatre of War Alfred McCormack, who was probably in
          as good<br>
          position as anyone to for judging the situation, felt that the<br>
          Japanese surrender could have been obtained in a few weeks by
          blockade<br>
          alone. "The Japanese had no longer enough food in stock, and
          their<br>
          fuel reserves were practically exhausted. We were mining all
          their<br>
          harbors and if we had brought this operation to its logical<br>
          conclusion, the destruction of Japanese cities with incendiary
          and<br>
          other bombs would have been quite unnecessary. But General
          Norstad<br>
          declared at Washington that this blockading action was a
          cowardly<br>
          proceeding unworthy of the Air Force. It was therefore
          discontinued."<br>
          <br>
          Page 863<br>
          <br>
          IT was equally clear that the defeat of Japan did not require
          the<br>
          A-bomb just as it did not require the Russian entry into the
          war or an<br>
          American invasion of the Japanese home islands. But again,
          other<br>
          factors involving interests and nonrational considerations
          were too<br>
          powerful. However, if the U.S. had not finished the bomb
          project or<br>
          had not used it, it seems most unlikely that the Soviet Union
          would<br>
          have made its postwar efforts to get the bomb.<br>
          <br>
          Page 864<br>
          <br>
          The Russian leaders would almost certainly not have made the<br>
          effort to get the bomb if we had not used it on Japan. On the
          other<br>
          hand, if we had not used the bomb on Japan, we would have been
          quite<br>
          incapable of preventing the Soviet forces from expanding
          wherever they<br>
          were ordered in Eurasia in 1946.<br>

          The growth of the army of specialists destroys one of the
          three<br>
          basic foundations of political democracy. These three bases
          are:<br>
          <br>
          1) that men are relatively equal in factual power;<br>
          2) that men have relatively equal access to the information
          needed to<br>
          make a government's decisions;<br>
          3) that men have a psychological readiness to accept majority
          rule in<br>
          return for those civil rights which will allow any minority to
          work to<br>
          build itself up to become a majority.<br>
          <br>
          Page 866<br>
          <br>
          It is increasingly clear that in the 20th century, the expert<br>
          will replace the industrial tycoon in control of the economic
          system<br>
          even as he will replace the democratic voter in control of the<br>
          political system. This is because planning will inevitably
          replace<br>
          laissez-faire in the relationships between the two systems.<br>
          Hopefully, the elements of choice and freedom may survive for
          the<br>
          ordinary individual in that he may be free to make a choice
          between<br>
          two opposing political groups (even if these groups have
          little policy<br>
          choice within the parameters of policy established by the
          experts) and<br>
          he may have the choice to switch his economic support from one
          large<br>
          unit to another. But in general, his freedom and choice will
          be<br>
          controlled within very narrow alternatives by the fact that he
          will be<br>
          numbered from birth and followed, as a number, through his
          educational<br>
          training, his required military and other public service, his
          tax<br>
          contributions, his health and medical requirements, and his
          final<br>

          One consequence of the nuclear rivalry has been the almost
          total<br>
          destruction of international law as existed from the middle of
          the<br>
          17th century to the end of the 19th. That old international
          law was<br>
          based on distinctions which no longer exist including the
          distinction<br>
          between war and peace, the rights of neutrals, the distinction
          between<br>
          public and private authority. These are now destroyed or in
          great<br>
          confusion.<br>
          <br>
          The post-war balance of terror reached its peak of total<br>
          disregard both of noncombatants and of neutrals in the
          policies of<br>
          John Foster Dulles who combined sanctimonious religion with
          "massive<br>
          retaliation wherever and whenever we judge fit" to the
          complete<br>
          destruction of any non-combatant or neutral status.<br>
          <br>
          Page 868<br>
          <br>
          As a result, all kinds of groups could destroy law and order
          without<br>
          suffering retaliation by ordinary powers and could become
          recognized<br>
          as states when they were totally lacking in the traditional
          attributes<br>
          of statehood. For example, the Leopoldville group were
          recognized as<br>
          the real government of the whole Congo in spite of the fact
          that they<br>
          were incapable of maintaining law and order over the area.
          Similarly,<br>
          a gang of rebels in Yemen in 1962 were instantly recognized
          before<br>
          they gave any evidence whatever of ability to maintain control
          or of<br>
          readiness to assume the existing international obligations of
          the<br>
          Yemen state and before it was established that their claims to
          have<br>
          killed the king were true.<br>

          <br>
          Under the umbrella of nuclear stalemate, outside governments<br>
          subsidize murders or revolts as the Russians did in Iraq and
          as the<br>
          American CIA did in several places, successfully in Iran in
          1953, and<br>
          in Guatemala in 1954 or very unsuccessfully as in the Cuban
          invasion<br>
          of 1961. Under the Cold War umbrella, small groups can obtain<br>
          recognition as states by securing the intervention (usually
          secret) of<br>
          some outside Power.<br>

          <br>
          The period 1945 to early 1963 forms a unity during which a
          number<br>
          of factors interacted upon one another to present a very
          complicated<br>
          and extraordinarily dangerous series of events. That mankind
          and<br>
          civilized life got through the period may be attributed to a
          number of<br>
          lucky chances rather than to any particular skill among the
          two<br>
          opposing political blocs.<br>
          <br>
          The Cold War is almost always described in terms which put
          minor<br>
          emphasis or even neglect the role of technological rivalry
          because<br>

          most historians do not feel competent to discuss it but
          chiefly<br>
          because much of the evidence is secret. Because of such
          secrecy, the<br>
          story of this rivalry falls into two quite distinct and even<br>
          contradictory parts:<br>
          <br>
          1) what the real situation was; and<br>
          2) what prevalent public opinion believed the situation to be.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the Soviet Union had an H-bomb many months before
          we<br>
          did when public opinion believed the opposite; the 1960
          believe<br>
          throughout the world of a so-called "missile gap" or American<br>
          inferiority in nuclear missiles when no such inferiority
          existed.<br>

          The balance of nuclear weapons was the central factor in the
          Cold<br>
          War. Cessation on nuclear testing came close to achievement in
          1950<br>
          when both sides had atomic weapons but was destroyed at that
          time by<br>
          President Truman's order to proceed with the development of
          the<br>
          hydrogen bomb. By 1963, both sides had these weapons and the
          balance<br>
          of terror had been achieved.<br>

          The party struggle in the U.S. found the intellectuals
          (including<br>
          scientists), the internationalists, the minorities and the<br>
          cosmopolitans in the Democratic Party with the businessmen,
          bankers<br>
          and clerks in the Republican Party. The Republicans had fallen
          into<br>
          the control (represented by Senators Taft, Wherry, Bridges and
          Jenner)<br>
          of those who were most ignorant of the real issues and were
          most<br>
          remote from any conceptions of national political
          responsibility.<br>
          <br>
          Page 880<br>
          <br>
          This group, to whom we often give the name "neo-isolationist,"<br>
          knew nothing of the world outside the U.S., and generally
          despised it.<br>
          Thus, they gave no consideration to our allies or neutrals,
          and saw no<br>
          reason to know or to study Russia, since it could be hated
          completely<br>
          without need for accurate knowledge. All foreigners were
          regarded as<br>
          unprincipled, weak, poor, ignorant and evil, with only one aim
          in<br>
          life, namely, to prey on the United States. These
          neo-isolationists<br>
          and unilateralists were equally filled with suspicion or
          hatred of any<br>
          American intellectuals, including scientists, because they had
          no<br>
          conception of any man who placed objective truth higher than<br>
          subjective interests since such an attitude was a complete
          challenge<br>
          to the American businessman's assumption that all men are and
          should<br>
          be concerned with the pursuit of self-interest and profit.<br>
          Neo-isolationism had a series of assumptions which could not
          be<br>
          held by anyone who had any knowledge of the world outside U.S.
          middleclass<br>
          business circles. These beliefs were seven in number:<br>
          <br>
          1) Unilateralism: that the U.S. should and could act by itself
          without<br>
          need to consider allies, neutrals or the Soviet Union;<br>
          <br>
          2) National omnipotence: that the U.S. is so rich and powerful
          that no<br>
          one else counts and that there is no need to study foreign
          areas,<br>
          customs, policies;<br>
          <br>
          Page 881<br>
          <br>
          3) Unlimited goals (or utopianism): the belief that there are
          final<br>
          solutions to the world's problems. Upholders of this view
          refused to<br>
          accept that constant danger and constant problems were a
          perpetual<br>
          condition of human life except in brief and unusual
          circumstances.<br>
          Dulles insisted that the Truman policy of containment must be
          replaced<br>
          by a policy of "liberation." These policies were not designed
          to win<br>
          conclusively and did not seek to solve the problem of the
          Soviet Union<br>
          but to live with it, "presumably forever." He did accept
          preventive<br>
          war in the form of massive retaliation if the Communists made
          any<br>
          further advances.<br>
          <br>
          4) The neo-isolationist belief that continuance of the Soviet
          threat<br>
          arose from internal treason within America.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(85 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          Page 882<br>
          <br>
          5) Since the chief "high moral principle" which motivated the
          neoisolationists<br>
          insisted that Soviet Russia and Democrats were engaged<br>
          in a joint tacit conspiracy to destroy America by high taxes
          by using<br>
          the Cold War to tax America into bankruptcy<br>
          <br>
          6) Since neo-isolationists rejected all partial solutions,
          there was<br>
          little they could do but talk loudly and sign anti-communist
          pacts.<br>
          <br>
          7) The unrealistic and unhistoric nature of neo-isolationism
          meant<br>
          that it could not actually be pursued as a policy. It was
          pursued by<br>
          John Foster Dulles with permanent injury to our allies. When
          Senator<br>
          McCarthy turned his extravagant charges of subversion and
          treason from<br>
          the State Department to the army, his downfall began. The
          neoisolationist<br>
          forces still continue in an increasingly irresponsible<br>
          form under a variety of names including John Birch Society
          members or<br>
          more generally as the "Radical Right."<br>
          <br>
          Page 885<br>
          <br>
          Robert Oppenheimer was on a total of thirty five government<br>
          committees. There was a shadow on Oppenheimer's past. In his
          younger<br>
          and more naive days, he had been closely associated with
          Communists.<br>
          Certainly never a Communist himself, and never, at any time,
          disloyal<br>
          to the U.S., he had nonetheless associated with Communists.
          His<br>
          brother Frank and his wife were Communist Party workers while<br>
          Oppenheimer's own wife was an ex-Communist, widow of a
          Communist who<br>
          had been killed fighting Fascism in Spain in 1937. The
          Oppenheimers<br>
          continued to have friends who were Communists and contributed
          money<br>
          until the end of 1941.<br>

          All this derogatory information was known to General Groves
          and<br>
          to Army Intelligence and used in 1953-1954 to destroy his
          reputation.<br>
          It was an essential element in the neo-isolationist
          McCarthyite,<br>

          IN the Soviet system, while most Russians lived in poverty, a<br>
          privileged minority, buying in special stores with special
          funds and<br>
          special ration cards, had access to luxuries undreamed of by
          the<br>
          ordinary person.<br>

          In 1944, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau took advantage
          of<br>
          his close personal friendship with Roosevelt to push forward
          his own<br>
          pet scheme to reduce Germany to a purely agricultural state by
          almost<br>
          total destruction of her industry, the millions of surplus
          population<br>
          to be, if necessary, deported to Africa. The secretary,
          supported by<br>
          his assistant secretary, Harry Dexter White, was deeply
          disturbed by<br>
          Germany's history of aggression. The only way to prevent it
          was to<br>
          reduce Germany's industry and thus her warmaking capacity as
          close to<br>
          nothing as possible. The resulting chaos, inflation, and
          misery would<br>
          be but slight repayment for the horrors Germany had inflicted
          on<br>
          others over many years.<br>
          <br>
          By personal influence, Morgenthau obtained acceptance of a<br>
          somewhat modified version of this plan by both Roosevelt and
          Churchill<br>
          at the Quebec conference of September 1944. The error at
          Quebec was<br>
          quickly repudiated but no real planning was done and the
          Morgenthau<br>
          Plan played a considerable role in the JCS 1067, the directive
          set up<br>
          to guide the American military occupation of Germany. It
          proposed<br>
          reparations be obtained by dismantling Germany industry. The
          JCS 1067<br>
          directive ordered that Germany be treated as a defeated enemy
          and not<br>
          as a liberated country. No steps were taken to secure its
          economic<br>
          recovery.<br>

          At the Potsdam conference, it was agreed that the German
          economy<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(86 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          should not be permitted should not be permitted to recover
          higher than<br>
          the standard of living of 1932, at the bottom of the
          depression, the<br>
          level, in fact, which had brought Hitler to power in 1933.<br>
          It took more than two years of misery for Germany to secure
          any<br>
          changes in these American objectives. Hunger and cold took a<br>
          considerable toll, and the Germans, for two years, experienced
          some of<br>
          the misery they had inflicted on others in the preceding dozen
          years.<br>
          The Germany currency reform of 1948 is the fiscal miracle of
          the<br>
          post-war world. From it came<br>
          <br>
          (1) an explosion of industrial expansion and economic
          prosperity for<br>
          West Germany;<br>
          (2) they tying of the West Germany economy to the West;<br>
          (3) an example for other western European in economic
          expansion; and<br>
          (4) a wave of prosperity for western Europe as a whole.<br>

          The American response to the Soviet refusal of postwar<br>
          cooperation was confused and tentative.<br>
          Winston Churchill in June 1946 spoke of the "Iron Curtain"
          which<br>
          Staling was lowering between the Soviet bloc and the West.<br>
          Lasting from 1947-1953, the chief characteristics of<br>
          "containment" were economic and financial aid to other nations
          to<br>
          eliminate the misery and ignorance which fosters communism.<br>

          Americans, when goals are established as they are in war, work<br>
          together very effectively, but political work in peacetime,
          with its<br>
          ambiguous goals, is relegated to rivalry, bickering, and total<br>
          inability to relate means to goals. As a result, the means
          themselves<br>
          tend to become goals.<br>

          Pearl Harbor was a total surprise. This last point was so hard
          to<br>
          believe, once the evidence was available, that the same groups
          who<br>
          were howling about Soviet espionage in 1948-1955 were also
          claiming<br>
          that Roosevelt expected and wanted Pearl Harbor. Both these
          beliefs,<br>
          if they were believed, were based on gigantic ignorance and<br>
          misconceptions about the nature of intelligence.<br>

          A great deal of nuclear information (whether secret or not is<br>
          unknown) as well as uranium metal, went to the Soviet Union as
          part of<br>
          Lend-Lease in 1943. Major George Racey Jordan, USAAF, tried in
          vain to<br>
          disrupt these shipments at the time. While most of Jordan's
          evidence<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(87 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          is unreliable, the shipment of uranium to Russia is
          corroborated from<br>
          other sources. The export licenses for such shipments were
          granted at<br>
          the request of General Groves. Jordan's other evidence, most
          of which<br>
          was very discreditable to the New Deal (since he testified
          that he,<br>
          Groves, and others were under direct pressure from Harry
          Hopkins to<br>
          allow export of nuclear materials) was subsequently shown to
          be false.<br>

          Much of the evidence on the Communist movement came from ex-<br>
          Communists such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, Whittaker<br>
          Chambers, John Lautner and others. The first three names
          mentioned are<br>
          known because they dramatized, distorted and manipulated
          evidence for<br>
          their own private purposes. This is particularly true of
          Elizabeth<br>
          Bentley who exaggerated her role.<br>

          The House Un-American Committee was aimed more at partisan<br>
          advantage than ascertaining the nature of the Communist
          conspiracy.<br>
          the truth cannot now be ascertained. Numerous other accused<br>
          Communists, both in government and out, whose names were given
          to the<br>
          committee in the same breath as Hiss or Lattimore were almost
          totally<br>
          ignored.<br>
          <br>
          Page 927<br>
          <br>
          Others called before the committee who refused to give
          evidence<br>
          under the Fifth Amendment which protects against
          self-incrimination<br>
          were in fact Communists and Bentley and Chambers knew them as
          such.<br>

          <br>
          The revelation of Communist influence in the U.S. was
          undoubtedly<br>
          valuable but the cost in damage to reputations of innocent
          persons was<br>
          very high. Much of this damage came from the efforts of
          Senator Joseph<br>
          McCarthy, Republican, of Wisconsin to prove that the State
          Department<br>
          and the army were widely infiltrated with Communists.<br>
          <br>
          Page 939<br>
          <br>
          McCarthy was not a conservative, still less a reactionary. He
          was<br>
          a fragment of elemental force, a throwback to primeval chaos.
          He was<br>
          the enemy of all order and all authority, with no respect, or
          even<br>
          understanding, for principles, laws, regulations, or rules. As
          such,<br>
          he had nothing to do with rationality or generality. Concepts,
          logic,<br>
          distinctions of categories were completely outside his world.
          It is<br>
          clear he did not have any idea what a Communist was, still
          less<br>
          Communism itself, and he did not care. This was simply a term
          he used<br>
          in his game of personal power. Most of the terms which have
          been<br>
          applied to him, such as "truculent," "brutal," "ignorant,"
          "sadistic,"<br>
          "foul-mouthed," "brash," are quite correct but not quite in
          the sense<br>
          that his enemies applied them, because they assumed that these<br>
          qualities and distinctions had meaning in his world as they
          did in<br>
          their own. They did not, because his behavior was all an act,
          the<br>
          things he did to gain the experience he wanted, that is, the
          feeling<br>
          of power, of creating fear, of destroying the rules, and of
          winning<br>
          attention and admiration for doing so. His act was that of
          Peck's Bad<br>
          Boy but on a colossal scale. He sought fame and acclaim by
          showing an<br>
          admiring world of schoolmates what a tough guy he was, defying
          all the<br>
          rules, even the rules of decency and ordinary civilized
          behavior. But<br>
          like the bad boy of the schoolyard, he had no conception of
          time or<br>
          anything established, and once he had found his act, it was
          necessary<br>
          to demonstrate it every day. His thirst for power, the power
          of mass<br>
          acclaim and publicity, reached the public scene at the same
          moment as<br>
          television, and he was the first to realize what could be done
          by<br>
          using the new instrument for reaching millions.<br>
          <br>
          His thirst for power was insatiable because like hunger, it
          was a<br>
          daily need. It had nothing to do with the power of authority
          or<br>
          regulated discipline, but the personal power of a sadist. All
          his<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(88 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          destructive instincts were against anything established, the
          wealthy,<br>
          the educated, the well-mannered, the rules of the Senate, the
          American<br>
          party system, the rules of fair play. As such, he had no
          conception of<br>
          truth or the distinction between it and falsehood, just as he
          had no<br>
          conception of yesterday, today, tomorrow as distinct entities.
          He<br>
          simply said whatever would satisfy, momentarily, his yearning
          to be<br>
          the center of the stage surrounded by admiring, fearful,
          shocked,<br>
          amazed people. He did not even care if their reaction was
          admiration,<br>
          fear, shock, or amazement and he did not care if they, as
          persons, had<br>
          the same reaction or a different one the next day or even a
          moment<br>
          later. He was exactly like an actor in a drama, one in which
          he had<br>
          made the script as he went along, full of falsehoods and<br>
          inconsistencies, and he was genuinely surprised and hurt if a
          person<br>
          whom he had abused and insulted for hours at a hearing did not
          walk<br>
          out with him to a bar or even to dinner the moment the hearing
          session<br>
          was over. He knew it was an act; he expected you to know it
          was an<br>
          act. There was really no hypocrisy in it, no cynicism, no
          falsehood,<br>
          as far as he was concerned, because he was convinced that this
          was the<br>
          way the world was. Everyone he was convinced, had a racket;
          this just<br>
          happened to be his, and he expected people to realize this and
          to<br>
          understand it.<br>
          <br>
          Page 930<br>
          <br>
          Of course, to the observant outsider who did not share his
          total<br>
          amorality, it was all false, invented as he went along, and
          constantly<br>
          changed, everything substantiated by documents pulled from his<br>
          briefcase and waved about too rapidly to be read. Mostly these<br>
          documents had nothing to do with what he was saying; mostly he
          had<br>
          never looked at them himself; they were merely props for the<br>
          performance, and to him, it was as silly for his audience to
          expect<br>
          such documents to be relevant as it would be for the audience
          in a<br>
          theater to expect the food that is being eaten, the whiskey
          that is<br>
          being drunk, or the documents which are read in that play to
          be<br>
          relevant to what the actor is saying.<br>
          <br>
          Every time he spoke, with each version he became a larger more<br>
          nonchalant hero. In 1952, he intimidated the Air Force into
          awarding<br>
          him the Distinguished Flying (given for twenty five combat
          missions)<br>
          although he had been a grounded intelligence officer who took<br>
          occasional rides in planes.<br>
          <br>
          Since laws and regulations were, for McCarthy, nonexistent,
          his<br>
          business and financial affairs are, like his life, a chaos of<br>
          illegalities.<br>
          <br>
          Page 931<br>
          <br>
          He seized upon Communism. "That's it," he said. "The
          government<br>
          is full of communists. We can hammer away at them." Without
          any real<br>
          conception of what he was doing, and without any research or
          knowledge<br>
          of the subject, on February 9, McCarthy waved a piece of paper
          and<br>
          said "I have here in my hand a list of 205 members of the
          Communist<br>
          Party still working and shaping the policy of the State
          Department.<br>

          On Feb 20th, in an incoherent speech in the Senate was six
          hours<br>
          of bedlam, as case after case was presented filled with
          contradictions<br>
          and irrelevancies. According to Senate Republican Leader Taft,
          "It was<br>
          a perfectly reckless performance." Nevertheless, Taft and his<br>
          colleagues determined to accept and support these charges
          since they<br>
          would injure the Administration. Few people realize that in
          five years<br>
          of accusations, McCarthy never turned up a Communist in the
          State<br>
          Department although undoubtedly there must have been some.<br>
          <br>
          Page 933<br>

          He claimed that "the top Russian espionage agent" in the U.S.,<br>
          Alger Hiss's boss in the State Department, "the chief
          architect of our<br>
          Far Eastern policy" was Professor Owen Lattimore. The trouble
          was<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(89 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          Lattimore was not a Communist, not a spy, and not employed by
          the<br>
          State department.<br>
          <br>
          In July, the Tydings subcommittee condemned McCarthy for a
          "fraud<br>
          and a hoax." McCarthy had the power of an inflamed and misled
          public<br>
          opinion. Tydings was beaten in Maryland in 1950. Benton from<br>
          Connecticut who introduced the resolution to expel McCarthy
          from the<br>
          Senate in 1951 and whose charges were fully supported by the
          Senate's<br>
          investigation of McCarthy's private finances, was defeated in
          1952.<br>
          During this period, McCarthy violated more laws and
          regulations than<br>
          any previous senator in history. When a reporter once said
          "Isn't that<br>
          a classified document?" McCarthy said, "It was. I just
          declassified<br>
          it."<br>
          <br>
          Page 934<br>

          Eisenhower was soon boasting that 1,456 Federal workers had
          been<br>
          "separated" in the first four months of the Eisenhower
          security<br>
          program. 2,200 at the end of the first year. Nixon said "We're
          kicking<br>
          the Communists and fellow travellers and security risks out of
          the<br>
          Government by the thousands." It was soon clear that no
          Communists<br>
          were kicked out and that security risks included all kinds of
          persons.<br>
          For a while, the Administration tried to outdo McCarthy by<br>
          demonstrating in hearings that China had been "lost" to the
          Communists<br>
          because of the careful planning and intrigue of Communists in
          the<br>
          State Department. But they failed to prove their contention.<br>
          <br>
          Page 935<br>
          <br>
          There is considerable truth in the China Lobby's contention
          that<br>
          the American experts on China were organized into a single<br>
          interlocking group which had a general consensus of a Leftish<br>
          character. It is also true that this group, from its control
          of funds,<br>
          academic recommendations, and research of publication
          opportunities,<br>
          could favor persons who accepted the established consensus and
          could<br>
          injure, financial or in professional advancement, persons who
          did not<br>
          accept it. It is also true that the established group, by its<br>
          influence on book reviewing in the New York Times, the Herald
          Tribune<br>
          and the Saturday Review, a few magazines including the
          "liberal<br>
          weeklies" and in the professional journals, could advance or
          hamper<br>
          any specialist's career. It is also true that these things
          were done<br>
          in the United States by the Institute of Pacific Relations,
          that this<br>
          organization had been infiltrated by Communists, and by
          Communist<br>
          sympathizers, and that much of this group's influence arose
          from its<br>
          access to and control over the flow of funds from financial<br>
          foundations to scholarly activities. All these things were
          true, but<br>
          they would have been true of many other areas of American
          scholarly<br>
          research and academic administration.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the charges of the China Lobby that China
          was<br>
          "lost" because of this group is not true. Yet the whole
          subject is of<br>
          major importance in understanding the twentieth century.<br>
          <br>
          Page 936<br>

          Lattimore, because he knew Mongolian, tended to become<br>
          everybody's expert. Many of these experts which were favored
          by the<br>
          Far East "establishment" in the Institute of Pacific RElations
          were<br>
          captured by Communist ideology. Under its influence, they<br>
          propagandized, as experts, erroneous ideas and sought to
          influence<br>
          policy in mistaken directions.<br>
          <br>
          Behind this unfortunate situation lies another, more profound,<br>
          relationship, which influences matters much broader than Far
          Eastern<br>
          policy. It involves the organization of tax-exempt fortunes of<br>
          international financiers into foundations to be used for
          educational,<br>
          scientific, and "other public purposes." Sixty or more years
          ago,<br>
          public life in the East was dominated by the influence of
          "Wall<br>
          Street" referring to international financial capitalism deeply<br>
          <br>

          involved in the gold standard, foreign exchange
          fluctuations,floating<br>

          This group, which in the United States, was completely
          dominated<br>
          by J.P. Morgan and Company from the 1880s to the 1930s was<br>
          cosmopolitan, Anglophile, internationalist, Ivy League,
          eastern<br>
          seaboard, high Episcopalian and European-culture conscious.
          Their<br>
          connection with the Ivy League colleges rested on the fact
          that large<br>
          endowments of these institutions required constant
          consultation with<br>
          the financiers of Wall Street and was reflected in the fact
          that these<br>
          endowments were largely in bonds rather than in real estate or
          common<br>
          stocks. As a consequence of these influences, J.P. Morgan and
          his<br>
          associates were the most significant figures in policy making
          at<br>
          Harvard, Columbia and Yale while the Whitneys and Prudential
          Insurance<br>
          Company dominated Princeton. The chief officials of these
          universities<br>
          were beholden to these financial powers and usually owed their
          jobs to<br>
          them.<br>
          <br>
          The significant influence of "Wall Street" (meaning Morgan)
          both<br>
          in the Ivy League and in Washington explains the constant
          interchange<br>
          between the Ivy League and the Federal Government, and
          interchange<br>
          which undoubtedly aroused a good deal of resentment in
          less-favored<br>
          circles who were more than satiated with the accents, tweeds,
          and High<br>
          Episcopal Anglophilia of these peoples. Poor Dean Acheson, in
          spite of<br>
          (or perhaps because of) his remarkable qualities of intellect
          and<br>
          character, took the full brunt of this resentment from
          McCarthy and<br>
          his allies. The same feeling did no good to pseudo-Ivy League
          figures<br>
          like Alger Hiss.<br>
          <br>
          Page 938<br>
          <br>
          In spite of the great influence of this "Wall Street"
          alignment,<br>
          an influence great enough to merit the name of the "American<br>
          Establishment," this group could not control the Federal
          Government<br>
          and, in consequence, had to adjust to a good many government
          actions<br>
          thoroughly distasteful to the group. The chief of these were
          in<br>
          taxation law, beginning with the graduated income tax in 1913,
          but<br>
          culminating above all else with the inheritance tax. These tax
          laws<br>
          drove the great private fortunes dominated by Wall Street into
          taxexempt<br>
          foundations which became the major link in the Establishment<br>
          network between Wall Street, the Ivy League and the Federal<br>
          government. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State after 1961, formerly<br>
          president of the Rockefeller Foundations, is as much a member
          of this<br>
          nexus as Alger Hiss, the Dulles brothers, Jerome Green, etc.<br>
          More than fifty years ago, the Morgan firm decided to
          infiltrate<br>
          the Left-wing political movements of the United States. This
          was<br>
          relatively easy to do since these groups were starved for
          funds and<br>
          eager for a voice to reach the people. Wall Street supplied
          both. The<br>
          purpose was not to destroy, dominate, or take over but was
          really<br>
          three-fold:<br>
          <br>
          1) to keep informed about the Left-wing or liberal groups;<br>
          2) to provide them with a mouthpiece so they could blow off
          steam;<br>
          3) to have a final "veto" on their actions if they ever went
          radical.<br>
          <br>
          There was nothing really new about this decision, since other<br>
          financiers had talked about it and even attempted it earlier.<br>
          The best example of the alliance of Wall Street and Left-wing<br>
          publication was "The New Republic" a magazine founded in 1914
          by<br>
          Willard Straight using Payne Whitney money. The original
          purpose for<br>
          establishing the paper was to provide an outlet for the
          progressive<br>
          Left and to guide it in an Anglophile direction. This latter
          task was<br>
          entrusted to Walter Lippmann.<br>
          <br>
          Willard Straight, like many Morgan agents, was present at the<br>
          Paris Peace Conference in 1919.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The first New Republic editor,Herbert Croly wrote, "Of course,<br>
          the Straights could always withdraw their financial support if
          they<br>
          ceased to approve of the policy of the paper;and in that
          event, it<br>
          would go out of existence as a consequence of their
          disapproval." The<br>
          chief achievement of The New Republic in 1914-1918 and again
          in 1938-<br>
          1948 was for interventionism in Europe.<br>
          <br>
          Page 942<br>
          <br>
          Straight allowed the Communists to come into the New Republic.<br>
          The first to arrive was Lew Frank.<br>
          <br>
          Page 944<br>
          <br>
          Frank joined a "Communist Research Group" which met in the<br>
          Manhattan home of the wealthy "Wall Street Red," Frederick
          Vanderbilt<br>
          Field.<br>

          To Morgan, all political parties were simply organizations to
          be<br>
          used, and the firm always was careful to keep a foot in all
          camps.<br>
          Like the Morgan interest libraries, museums and art, its<br>
          recognition of the need for social work among the poor went
          back to<br>
          the original founder of the firm, George Peabody. To this same
          figure<br>
          may be attributed the use of tax-exempt foundations for
          controlling<br>
          these activities as in the use of Peabody foundations to
          support<br>
          Peabody libraries and museums. Unfortunately, we do not have
          space<br>
          here for this great and untold story, but it must be
          remembered that<br>
          what we do say is part of a much larger picture.<br>
          <br>
          Our concern at the moment is with the links between Wall
          Street<br>
          and the Left, especially the Communists. Here the chief link
          was the<br>
          Thomas W. Lamont family. Tom Lamont was brought into the
          Morgan firm,<br>
          as Straight several years later, by Henry P. Davison, a Morgan<br>
          partner. Each had a wife who became a patroness of Leftish
          causes and<br>
          two sons, of which the elder was a conventional banker, and
          the<br>
          youngest was a Left-wing sympathizer and sponsor.<br>
          HUAC files show Tom Lamont, his wife Flora, and his son
          Corliss<br>
          as sponsors and financial angels to almost twenty extreme Left<br>
          organizations, including the Communist Party itself.<br>
          <br>
          Page 946<br>
          <br>
          In 1951, the McCarran Committee sought to show that China had
          not<br>
          been lost to the Communists by the deliberate actions of a
          group of<br>
          academic experts on the Far East and Communist fellow
          travellers whose<br>
          work in that direction was controlled and coordinated by the
          Institute<br>
          of Pacific Relations (IPR). The influence of the Communists in
          the IPR<br>
          is well established but the patronage of Wall Street is less
          well<br>
          known.<br>
          <br>
          The IPR was a private association of ten independent national<br>
          councils in ten countries concerned with affairs in the
          Pacific. Money<br>
          for the American Council of the IPR came from the Carnegie
          Foundation<br>
          and the Rockefeller Foundation. The financial deficits which
          occurred<br>
          each year were picked up by financial angels, almost all with
          close<br>
          Wall Street connections. There can be little doubt that the
          IPR line<br>
          had many points in common both with the Kremlin's party line
          on the<br>
          Far East and with the State Department's police line in the
          same area.<br>
          Clearly there were some Communists, even party members,
          involved but<br>
          it is much less clear that there was any disloyalty to the
          U.S. There<br>
          was a great deal of intrigue both to help those who agreed
          with the<br>
          IPR line and to influence U.S. government policy in this
          direction,<br>
          but there is no evidence of which I am aware of any explicit
          plot or<br>
          conspiracy to direct American policy in a direction favorable
          either<br>
          to the Soviet Union or to international Communism.<br>
          <br>
          Page 948<br>
          <br>
          It must be confessed that the IPR had many of the marks of a<br>
          fellow traveller or Communist "captive" organization. But this
          does<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(92 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          not mean that the Radical Right version of these events is
          accurate.<br>
          For example, Elizabeth Bentley testified on the IPR and
          identified<br>
          almost every person associated with the organization as a
          Communist.<br>
          <br>
          Page 949<br>
          <br>
          This Radical Right fairy tale, which is not an accepted folk
          myth<br>
          in many groups in America, pictured the recent history of the
          United<br>
          States as a well-organized plot of extreme Left-wing elements,<br>
          operating from the White House itself and controlling all the
          chief<br>
          avenues of publicity in the United States. This plot, if we
          are to<br>
          believe the myth, worked through such avenues as the New York
          Times,<br>
          Herald Tribute, Christian Science Monitor, Washington Post,
          Atlantic<br>
          Monthly, and Harper's Magazine and had at its core the
          wild-eyed and<br>
          bushy-haired theoreticians of Socialist Harvard and the London
          School<br>
          of Economics. It was determined to bring the U.S. into World
          War II on<br>
          the side of England (Roosevelt's first love) and Soviet Russia
          (his<br>
          second love) and, as part of this consciously planned scheme,
          invited<br>
          Japan to attack Pearl Harbor all the while undermining
          America's real<br>
          strength by excessive spending and unbalanced budgets.<br>
          <br>
          Page 950<br>
          <br>
          This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of
          truth.<br>
          There does exist and has existed for a generation, an
          international<br>
          Anglophile network which operates to some extent in the way
          the<br>
          Radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this
          network,<br>
          which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no
          aversion to<br>
          cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and
          frequently<br>
          does so. I know of the operations of this network because I
          have<br>
          studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years,
          in the<br>
          early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have
          no<br>
          aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my
          life,<br>
          been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have
          objected, both<br>
          in the past and recently, to a few of its policies but in
          general my<br>
          chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain
          unknown, and I<br>
          believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.<br>
          The Round Table Groups have already been mentioned several
          times.<br>
          At the risk of some repetition, the story will be summarized
          here<br>
          because the American branch of this organization (sometimes
          called the<br>
          "Eastern Establishment) has played a very significant role in
          the<br>
          history of the United States in the last generation.<br>
          <br>
          The Round Table Groups were semi-secret discussion and
          lobbying<br>
          groups whose original purpose was to federate the
          English-speaking<br>
          world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes. By 1915, Round
          Table<br>
          groups existed in seven countries including England, South
          Africa,<br>
          Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the United States.<br>
          <br>
          Page 951<br>
          <br>
          Money for their activities originally came from Cecil Rhodes,<br>
          J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families and
          associates of<br>
          bankers Lazard Brothers and Morgan, Grenfell and Company.<br>
          The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the
          already<br>
          existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in
          New<br>
          York to a group of international financiers in London led by
          Lazard<br>
          Brothers.<br>
          Lionel Curtis established in England and each dominion a front<br>
          organization to the existing local Round Table Group. This
          front<br>
          organization called the Royal Institute of Public Affairs, had
          as its<br>
          nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group.<br>
          <br>
          Page 952<br>
          <br>
          In New York, it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations
          and<br>
          was a front for J.P. Morgan and Company in association with
          the very<br>
          small American Round Table Group. The American organizers were<br>
          dominated by the large number of Morgan "experts" including
          Lamont and<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(93 of 129) [14/06/2005 11:42:40]<br>
          <br>
          Beer, who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there
          became<br>
          close friends with the similar group of English "experts"
          which had<br>
          been recruited by the Milner group. In fact, the original
          plans for<br>
          the Royal Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations.<br>
          In 1928, the Council on Foreign Relations was dominated by the<br>
          associates of the Morgan bank. Closely allied with this Morgan<br>
          influence were a small group of Wall Street lawyers whose
          chief<br>
          figures were Elihu Root, John W. Davis, the Dulles Brothers,
          John J.<br>
          McCloy.<br>
          <br>
          Page 953<br>
          <br>
          On this basis, there grew up in the 20th century a power<br>
          structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply
          into<br>
          university life, the press, and the practice of foreign
          policy.<br>
          The American branch of this "English Establishment" exerted
          much<br>
          of its influence through five American newspapers (New York
          Times and<br>
          Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, Washington Post,
          Boston<br>
          Evening Transcript). It might be pointed out that the
          existence of<br>
          this Wall Street Anglo-American axis is quite obvious once it
          is<br>
          pointed out. It is reflected by the fact that such Wall Street<br>
          luminaries such as John W. Davis, Lewis Douglas, Jock Whitney
          and<br>
          Douglas Dillon were appointed to be American ambassadors in
          London.<br>
          This double international network in which the Round Table
          groups<br>
          formed the semi-secret or secret nuclei of the Institutes of<br>
          International Affairs was extended into a third network for
          Pacific<br>
          Affairs in 1925 by the same people for the same motives.<br>
          <br>
          Page 954<br>
          <br>
          The chief aims of this elaborate, semi-secret organization
          were<br>
          largely commendable: to coordinate the international
          activities and<br>
          outlooks of all the English-speaking world into one; to work
          to<br>
          maintain peace; to help backward, colonial, and underdeveloped
          areas<br>
          toward prosperity along the lines somewhat similar to those
          taught at<br>
          Oxford and the University of London.<br>
          <br>
          These organizations and their financial backers were in no
          sense<br>
          reactionary or Fascistic persons, as Communist propaganda
          would like<br>
          to depict them. Quite the contrary, they were gracious and
          cultured<br>
          gentlemen who were much concerned with the freedom of
          expression of<br>
          minorities and the rule of law for all and who were convinced
          that<br>
          they could forcefully civilize the Boers, the Irish, the
          Arabs, and<br>
          the Hindus, and who are largely responsible for the partitions
          of<br>
          Ireland, Palestine, and India. If their failures now loom
          larger than<br>
          their successes, this should not be allowed to conceal the
          high<br>
          motives with which they attempted both.<br>
          <br>
          It was this group of people, whose wealth and influence so<br>
          exceeded their experience and understanding, who provided much
          of the<br>
          framework of influence which the Communist sympathizers and
          fellow<br>
          travellers took over in the United States in the 1930s. It
          must be<br>
          recognized that the power of these energetic Left-wingers
          exercised<br>
          was never their own power or Communist power but was
          ultimately the<br>
          power of the international financial coterie, and, once the
          anger and<br>
          suspicions of the American people were aroused as they were in
          the<br>
          1950s, it was a fairly simple matter to get rid of the Red<br>
          sympathizers. Before this could be done, however, a
          congressional<br>
          committee, following backward to their source the threads
          which led<br>
          from the admitted Communists like Whittaker Chambers, through
          Alger<br>
          Hiss, and the Carnegie Endowment to Thomas Lamont and the
          Morgan Bank,<br>
          fell into the whole complicated network of the interlocking
          tax-exempt<br>
          foundations. The Eighty-third Congress set up in 1953 a
          Special Reece<br>
          Committee to investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. It soon
          became clear<br>
          that people of immense wealth would be unhappy if the
          investigation<br>
          went too far and that the "most respected" newspapers in the
          country,<br>
          closely allied with these men of wealth, would not get excited
          enough<br>

          <br>
          about any revelations to make the publicity worthwhile. An
          interesting<br>
          report showing the Left-wing associations of interlocking
          nexus of<br>
          tax-exempt foundations was issued in 1954 rather quietly..
          Four years<br>
          later, the Reece Committee's general counsel, Rene A Wormser,
          wrote a<br>
          shocked, but not shocking, book on the subject called
          "Foundations:<br>
          Their Power and Influence."<br>

          Jerome Green is a symbol of much more than the Wall Street<br>
          influence in the IPR. He is also a symbol of the relationship
          between<br>
          the financial circles of London and those of the eastern U.S.
          which<br>
          reflects one of the most powerful influences in 20th century
          American<br>
          and world history. The two ends of this English-speaking axis
          have<br>
          sometimes been called, perhaps facetiously, the English and
          American<br>
          Establishments. There is, however, a considerable degree of
          truth<br>
          behind the joke, a truth which reflects a very real power
          structure.<br>
          It is this power structure which the Radical Right in the U.S.
          has<br>
          been attacking for years in the belief they are attacking the<br>
          Communists. These misdirected attacks did much to confuse the
          American<br>
          people in 1948-1955. By 1953 most of these attacks had run
          their<br>
          course. The American people, thoroughly bewildered at the
          widespread<br>
          charges of twenty years of treason and subversion, had
          rejected the<br>
          Democrats and put into the White House a war hero, Eisenhower.
          At the<br>
          time,two events, one public and one secret, were still in
          process. The<br>
          public one was the Korean War; the secret one was the race for
          the<br>
          thermonuclear bomb.<br>

          CHAPTER XVIII: NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND COLD WAR,<br>
          RACE FOR THE H-BOMB 1950-1957<br>

          <br>
          On March 1, 1954, we exploded our first real thermonuclear
          bomb<br>
          at Bikini atoll. It was a horrifying device which spread
          death-dealing<br>
          radioactive contamination over more than 8,000 square miles
          and<br>
          injurious radiation over much of the world.<br>
          <br>
          Page 968<br>
          <br>
          To prepare public opinion to accept use of the H-bomb, if it<br>
          became necessary, Strauss sponsored a study of radioactive
          fallout<br>
          whose conclusion was prejudged by calling it "Project
          Sunshine." By<br>
          selective release of some evidence and strict secrecy of other<br>
          information, they tried to establish in public opinion that
          there was<br>
          no real danger to anyone from nuclear fallout even in all-out
          nuclear<br>
          war. This gave rise to controversy between the scientists and
          the<br>
          Administration on the danger of fallout.<br>
          <br>
          The Eisenhower through the Dulles doctrine of "massive<br>
          retaliation" was so deeply committed to nuclear war that it
          could not<br>
          permit the growth of public opinion which would refuse to
          accept the<br>
          use of nuclear weapons because of objections to the danger of
          fallout<br>
          to neutrals and non-combatants. By 1953, this struggle became
          so<br>
          intense that supporters of massive retaliation decided they
          must<br>
          destroy the public image and public career of Oppenheimer.<br>

          The emphasis on nuclear retaliation to Communist aggression<br>
          anywhere in the world made it necessary to draw a defence
          perimeter<br>
          over which such aggression would trigger retaliation. At the<br>
          insistence of MacArthur, that perimeter was drawn to exclude
          Korea,<br>
          Formosa and Mainland China; accordingly, all American forces
          had been<br>
          evacuated from South Korea in June 1949.<br>
          <br>
          Page 971<br>
          <br>
          The Soviet Union interpreted this to mean that the U.S. would<br>

          allow South Korea to be conquered by the North. Instead, when
          Russia,<br>
          through its satellite North Korea, sought to take Korea, this
          game<br>
          rise to an American counteraction.<br>
          <br>
          Page 972<br>
          <br>
          For forty-eight hours after the Korean attack, the world<br>
          hesitated, awaiting America's reaction. Truman immediately
          committed<br>
          American air and sea forces in the area south of 38 degrees
          and<br>
          demanded a UN condemnation of the aggression. Thus, for the
          first time<br>
          in history, a world organization voted to use collective force
          to stop<br>
          armed aggression. This was possible because the North Korean
          attack<br>
          occurred at a time when the Soviet delegation was absent from
          the UN<br>
          Security Council, boycotting it as a protest at the presence
          of the<br>
          delegation from Nationalist China. Accordingly, the much-used
          Soviet<br>
          veto was unavailable.<br>
          <br>
          Page 974<br>

          The frontier was reached by UN forces as the month ended. The
          Red<br>
          Chinese decision to intervene was made nine days after
          American troops<br>
          crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. It was inevitable
          as Red<br>
          China could hardly be expected to allow the buffer North
          Korean state<br>
          to be destroyed and American troops to occupy the line of the
          Yalu. As<br>
          soon as it became clear that American forces would continue
          past the<br>
          38th parallel to the Yalu, the Chinese intervened, not to
          restore the<br>
          38th parallel frontier but to clear the U.N. forces from Asia<br>
          completely.<br>

          The Truman Administration, after the victory at Inchon, did
          not<br>
          intend to stop at the 38th parallel and hoped to reunite the
          country<br>
          under the Seoul government. It is probable that this alone
          triggered<br>
          the Chinese intervention.<br>
          On October 9, 1950, two of MacArthur's planes attacked a
          Russian<br>
          air base sixty-two miles inside Russian territory.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          After Truman removed MacArthur, Republican leaders spoke
          publicly<br>
          of impeaching the President. Senator William Jenner said: This
          country<br>
          today is in the hands of a secret inner coterie which is
          directed by<br>
          agents of the Soviet Union. We must cut this whole cancerous<br>
          conspiracy out at once. Our only choice is to impeach the
          president<br>
          and find out who is the secret invisible government which has
          so<br>
          cleverly led our country down the road to destruction."<br>

          On the whole, neo-isolationist discontent was a revolt of the<br>
          ignorant against the informed or educated, of the nineteenth
          century<br>
          against the insoluble problems of the twentieth, of the
          Midwest of Tom<br>
          Sawyer against the cosmopolitan East of J.P. Morgan and
          Company, of<br>
          old Siwash against Harvard, of the Chicago Tribune against the<br>
          Washington Post or New York Times, of simple absolutes against
          complex<br>
          relativisms, of immediate final solutions against long-range
          partial<br>
          alleviations, of frontier activism against European though, a<br>
          rejection, out of hand, of all the complexities of life which
          had<br>
          arisen since 1915 in favor of a nostalgic return to the
          simplicities<br>
          of 1905, and above all a desire to get back to the
          inexpensive,<br>
          thoughtless, and irresponsible international security of 1880.<br>
          <br>
          Page 980<br>
          <br>
          This neurotic impulse swept over the U.S. in a great wave in
          the<br>
          years 1948-1955, supported by hundreds of thousands of
          self-seeking<br>
          individuals, especially peddlers of publicity and propaganda,
          and<br>
          financed no longer by the relatively tied-up funds of
          declining Wall<br>
          Street international finance, but by its successors, the
          freely<br>
          available winnings of self-financing industrial profits from
          such new<br>
          industrial activities as air power, electronics, chemicals,
          which<br>
          pretended to themselves that their affluence was entirely due
          to their<br>

          own cleverness. At the head of this list were the new
          millionaires led<br>
          by the Texas oil pluggers whose fortunes were based on tricky
          tax<br>
          provisions and government-subsidized transportation systems.<br>

          During Truman's last four budgets, expenditures on national<br>

          The Korean War disrupted the pleasures of the postwar economic<br>
          boom with military service, shortages, restrictions and
          cost-of-living<br>
          inflation which could not help but breed discontent. And
          through it,<br>
          all the mobilized wealth of the country, in alliance with most
          of the<br>
          press, kept up a constant barrage of "Communists in
          Washington,"<br>
          "twenty years of treason." In creating this picture, the
          leaders of<br>
          the Republican Party totally committed themselves to the myths
          of the<br>
          neo-isolationists and of the Radical Right.<br>
          <br>
          In June 1951, Senator McCarthy delivered a speech in the
          Senate<br>
          of 60,000 words attacking General Marshall as a man "steeped
          in<br>
          falsehood" who has "recourse to the lie whenever it suits his<br>
          convenience," one of the architects of America's foreign
          policy made<br>
          by "men high in Government who are concerting to deliver us to<br>
          disaster, a conspiracy so black that when it is finally
          exposed, its<br>
          principals shall be forever deserving of the maledictions of
          all<br>
          honest men."<br>

          Eisenhower had no particular assets except a bland and amiable<br>
          disposition combined with his reputation as a victorious
          general. He<br>
          also had a weakness, one which is frequently found in his
          profession,<br>
          the conviction that anyone who has become a millionaire, even
          by<br>
          inheritance, is an authoritative person on almost any subject.<br>

          If elected, he would go to Korea to make peace. Although
          himself<br>
          not a neo-isolationist or a reactionary, Eisenhower had few
          deep<br>
          personal convictions and was eager to be president. When his
          advisers<br>
          told him that he must collaborate with the Radical Right, he
          went all<br>
          the way, even to the extent of condoning McCarthy's attack on
          General<br>
          Marshall when he, under McCarthy's pressure, removed a
          favorable<br>
          reference to Marshall from a Wisconsin speech.<br>
          <br>
          Eisenhower allotted the functions of government to his Cabinet<br>
          members ("eight millionaires and a plumber").<br>

          Attorney General Herbert Brownell confided to a businessmen's<br>
          luncheon in Chicago that President Truman, knowing that Harry
          Dexter<br>
          White was a Russian spy, had promoted him from assistant
          secretary of<br>
          the treasury to executive director of the U.S. Mission to the<br>
          International Monetary Fund in 1946. The House Committee on
          Un-<br>
          American activities at once issued a subpoena to the
          ex-President to<br>
          testify which was ignored.<br>

          McCarthy's attacks on the U.S. Information Agency overseas<br>
          libraries led to burning of books like Tom Sawyer and Robin
          Hood as<br>
          subversive (Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the
          poor,<br>

          Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union." This
          charge was<br>
          supported by a biased rehash of all the derogatory stories
          about<br>
          Oppenheimer and was made up of wild charges which no
          responsible<br>
          person has ever been willing to defend." On the basis of this
          letter<br>
          and at the direct order of President Eisenhower, Chairman
          Strauss<br>
          suspended Oppenheimer's security clearance.<br>

          Immediately after Stalin's death, the "collective leadership"
          was<br>
          headed by Malenkov, Beria and Molotov. Malenkov supported a
          policy of<br>
          relaxation with increased emphasis on production of consumers
          goods<br>
          and rising standards of living, as well as increased efforts
          to avoid<br>
          any international crises which might lead to war; Beria
          supported a<br>
          "thaw" in internal matters, with large-scale amnesties for
          political<br>
          prisoners as well as rehabilitation of those already
          liquidated;<br>
          Molotov continued to insist on the "hard" policies of Stalin
          with no<br>
          relaxation of domestic tyranny.<br>

          Wild rumors and and some relaxation, at Beria's behest, in
          East<br>
          Germany, gave rise to false hopes and on June 16, 1953, these
          workers<br>
          rose up against the Communist government. These uprising were
          crushed<br>
          with the full power of the Soviet occupation armored
          divisions. Using<br>
          this as an excuse, the Kremlin leaders suddenly arrested Beria
          and<br>
          shot him.<br>

          The overthrow of the master of terror was followed by an<br>
          extensive curtailment of the secret police and its powers.

          Khrushchev's six-day visit to Tito is of great importance
          because<br>
          it showed Russia in an apologetic role for a major past error
          and<br>
          because it reversed Stalin's rule that all Communist parties<br>
          everywhere must follow the Kremlin's leadership such that
          "differences<br>
          in the concrete application of Socialism are the exclusive
          concern of<br>
          individual countries." En route home, he stopped in Sofia and
          place<br>
          the fuse in another, even larger, stick of dynamite, by a
          secret<br>
          denunciation of Stalin personally as a bloodthirsty tyrant.
          Back in<br>
          Moscow, Khrushchev won over the majority by arguing that the
          loyalty<br>
          of the satellites, and especially their vital economic
          cooperation,<br>
          could be ensured better by a loose leash than by a club.<br>

          At the Twentieth Party Congress in February 1956, the first<br>
          speech of 50,000 words delivered by Khrushchev over seven
          hours urged<br>
          the need for coexistence with the West and references to the<br>
          possibility of peaceful rather than revolutionary change from<br>
          capitalism to Socialism.<br>
          <br>
          The real explosion came at a secret all-night session on July
          24<br>
          in a 30,000 word speech where Khrushchev made a horrifying
          attack on<br>
          Stalin as a bloodthirsty and demented tyrant who had destroyed
          tens of<br>
          thousands of loyal party members on falsified evidence. The
          full<br>
          nightmare of the Soviet system was revealed.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1017<br>
          <br>
          A few passages from this speech:<br>
          <br>
          "This concept "enemy of the people" eliminated any possibility
          of<br>
          rebuttal. Usually, the only evidence used, against all the
          rules of<br>
          modern legal science, was the confession of the accused, and
          as<br>
          subsequent investigation showed, such "confessions" were
          obtained by<br>
          physical pressure on the accused. The formula "enemy of the
          people"<br>
          was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically
          annihilating<br>
          these persons.<br>
          <br>
          How is it that a person confesses to crimes that he has not<br>
          committed? Only in one way - by application of physical
          pressure,<br>
          tortures, taking away of his human dignity.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1019<br>
          <br>
          The "secret speech" also destroyed Stalin's reputation as a<br>
          military genius:<br>
          <br>
          "Stalin said that the tragedy of the war resulted from the<br>
          unexpected attack by the Germans. This is completely untrue.
          Churchill<br>
          warned Stalin that the Germans were going to attack. Stalin
          took no<br>
          had and warned that no credence be given to information of
          this sort<br>
          not to provoke a German invasion. Had our industry been
          mobilized<br>
          properly and in time to supply the army, our wartime losses
          would have<br>
          been decidedly smaller.<br>
          <br>
          Very grievous consequences followed Stalin's destruction of
          many<br>
          military commanders during 1937-1941 because of his
          suspiciousness and<br>
          false accusations. During that time, leaders who had gained
          military<br>
          experience in Spain and the Far East were almost completely<br>
          liquidated.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1021<br>
          <br>
          Stalin's 1948 "Short Biography" is an expression of most<br>
          dissolute flattery, making a man into a god, transforming him
          into an<br>
          infallible sage, "the greatest leader and most sublime
          strategist of<br>
          all times and nations." We need not give examples of the
          loathsome<br>
          adulation filling this book. They were all approved and edited
          by<br>
          Stalin personally. He added "Although he performed his task of
          leader<br>
          of the people with consummate skill and enjoyed the unreserved
          support<br>
          of the whole Soviet people, Stalin never allowed his work to
          be marred<br>
          by the slightest hint of vanity, conceit, or self-adulation."
          I'll<br>
          cite one more insertion by Stalin: "Comrade Stalin's genius
          enabled<br>
          him to divine the enemy's plans and defeat them. The battles
          in which<br>
          Comrade Stalin directed the Soviet armies are brilliant
          examples of<br>
          operational military skill." "<br>
          <br>
          Page 1022<br>
          <br>
          By directing all the criticism of Stalin personally, he<br>
          exculpated himself and the other Bolshevik survivors who were
          fully as<br>
          guilty as Stalin was - guilty not merely because they
          acquiesced in<br>
          Stalin's atrocities from fear, as admitted in Khrushchev's
          speech, but<br>
          because they fully cooperated with him.<br>
          <br>
          A study of Khrushchev's life shows that he defended Stalin's
          acts<br>
          which caused the deaths of millions. The fault was not merely
          with<br>
          <br>

          Stalin; it was with the system, it was with Russia.<br>
          The more completely total and irresponsible power is
          concentrated<br>
          in one man's hands, the more frequently will a monster of
          sadism be<br>
          produced.<br>
          <br>
          The very structure of Russian life drove Khrushchev, as it had<br>
          driven Stalin, to concentrate all power in his own hands.
          Neither man<br>
          could relax halfway to power for fear that someone else would
          continue<br>
          on, seeking the peak of power. The basis of the whole system
          was fear<br>
          and like all neurotic drives in a neurotic system, such fear
          could not<br>
          be overcome even by achievement of total power. That is why it
          grows<br>
          into paranoia as it did with Ivan the Terrible, Peter the
          Great, Paul<br>
          I, Stalin and others.<br>

          Having failed to block Khrushchev's economic plans, his rivals
          in<br>
          the Presidium were reduced to a last resort, they had to get
          rid of<br>
          the man himself. At a Presidium meeting on June 18, 1957, the
          motion<br>
          was made to remove Khrushchev as the first party secretary.
          The<br>
          discussion grew violent with Malenkov and Molotov attaching
          and<br>
          Khrushchev defending himself. He was accused of practicing a
          "cult of<br>
          personality" and of economic mismanagement. The vote was 7-4
          against<br>
          him with Mikoyan, Kirichenko and Suslov his only supporters.
          He was<br>
          offered the reduced position of minister of agriculture.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1032<br>
          <br>
          Khrushchev refused to accept the result, denying that the<br>
          Presidium had the authority to remove a first secretary, and
          appealing<br>
          to the Central Committee. The members of this larger group
          joined in<br>
          the discussions as they arrived while Khrushchev's supporters
          sought<br>
          to delay the vote until his men could come in from the
          provinces.<br>
          Marshall Zhukov provided planes to bring in the more distant
          ones. The<br>
          discussion became bitter when Zhukov threatened to produce
          evidence<br>
          that Malenkov and Molotov had been deeply involved in the
          bloody<br>
          purges of 1937. Madame Furtseva, an alternate member of the
          Presidium,<br>
          filibustered with a speech for six hours. Eventually, there
          were 309<br>
          members present. When the vote was finally taken, Khrushchev's<br>
          supporters voted for him solidly and his removal, already
          voted by the<br>
          Presidium, was reversed. Khrushchev at once counterattacked.
          He moved<br>
          and carried the expulsion from the Presidium of Malenkov,
          Molotov,<br>
          Kaganovich and Shepilov for "anti-party" activities. Then came
          the<br>
          election of a new Presidium with fifteen full members instead
          than the<br>
          previous eleven, and nine alternates instead of the previous
          six.<br>
          This change was Khrushchev's most smashing personal victory
          and<br>
          the most significant event in Russia's internal history. It
          led<br>
          Khrushchev to a position of political power more complete than<br>
          Stalin's had been although it was clear that Khrushchev would
          never be<br>
          allowed to abuse his power the way Stalin had done.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1033<br>
          <br>
          Khrushchev did not rest on his oars. During the summer of
          1957,<br>
          he made notable concessions to the peasants (ending compulsory<br>
          deliveries from products of their personal plots), slammed
          down the<br>
          lid on freedom of writers and artists, pushed vigorously both
          the<br>
          "virgin lands" scheme and the decentralization of industry,
          and worked<br>
          to curtail the growing autonomy of the armed forces and
          revived trade<br>
          unions into the new regional economic councils.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1034<br>

          Russian objection to city-bombing or to strategic terror of
          the<br>
          V-2 kind as ineffective and a waste of resources was
          undoubtedly<br>
          sincere.<br>
          <br>
          The Soviet Union has no idea of being able to achieve military<br>
          victory over the United States simply because they have no
          method of<br>
          occupying the territory of the United States at any stage in a
          war.<br>

          They are unlikely to use nuclear weapons first although fully<br>
          prepared to resort to them once they are used by an enemy.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1036<br>
          <br>
          However such a war is regarded by the Soviet leaders as highly<br>
          undesirable while they, in a period of almost endless cold
          war, can<br>
          seek to destroy capitalist society by nonviolent means. This
          theory of<br>
          "nibbling" the capitalist world to death is combined with a
          tactic<br>
          which would resist "capitalist imperialism" by encouraging
          "anticolonialism."<br>
          Stalin and Dulles saw the world largely in black-and-white
          terms:<br>
          who was not with them was obviously against them.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1037<br>
          <br>
          Stalin did not see the possibility of colonial areas becoming<br>
          non-Communist and non-colonial independent states and rebuffed
          the<br>
          local native groups. Khrushchev did the opposite.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1038<br>
          <br>
          This shift in the Soviet attitude toward neutralism was helped
          by<br>
          Dulles' refusal to accept the existence of neutralism. His
          rebuffs<br>
          tended to drive those areas which wanted to be neutral into
          the arms<br>
          of Russian because the new nations of the developing Buffer
          Fringe<br>
          valued their independence above all else. The Russian
          acceptance of<br>
          neutralism may be dated about 1954 while Dulles still felt
          strongly<br>
          adverse to neutralism four or five years later. This gave the
          Soviet<br>
          Union a chronological advantage to compensate for its many<br>
          disadvantages in the basic struggle to win the favor of the
          neutrals.<br>

          THE COLD WAR IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ASIA, 1950-1957<br>

          <br>
          By 1939, there was only one independent state in southeast
          Asia:<br>
          Siam. Thus all southeast Asia, except Thailand, was under the
          colonial<br>
          domination of five Western states in 1939.<br>
          <br>
          French Indochina emerged from Japanese occupation as the three<br>
          states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, each claiming
          independence.<br>
          Efforts by the European Powers to restore their prewar rule
          led to<br>
          violent clashes with the supporters of independence. These
          struggles<br>
          were brief and successful in Burma and Indonesia but were very<br>
          protracted in Indochina.<br>

          <br>
          In all these areas, native nationalists were inclined to the<br>
          political Left, if for no other reason than the fact that the<br>
          difficulties of capital accumulation and investment to finance<br>
          economic improvements could be achieved only under state
          control. In<br>
          some cases, such Communism may have been ideological but
          inmost cases,<br>
          it involved little more than the desire to play off the Soviet
          Union<br>
          and China against the Western imperialist Powers.<br>

          A communist revolt in the Philippines had already begun and
          was<br>
          joined by similar uprisings in Burma, Indonesia, and Malaya.
          Most of<br>
          these revolts took the form of agrarian agitations and armed
          raids by<br>
          Communist guerrilla jungle fighters. Since the operated on a
          hit-andrun<br>
          basis and had to live off the local peasantry, their
          exploitation<br>
          of peasant life eventually made them decreasingly welcome to
          this very<br>
          group for whom they pretended to be fighting.<br>
          In the Philippines, the rebels were smashed in 1953. In<br>
          Indonesia, Sukarno repressed the insurrection and executed its<br>
          leaders. In Malaya, the Communists were systematically hunted
          down and<br>
          destroyed by British troops. In Burma, they weren't eliminated
          until<br>
          1960.<br>
          <br>
          The real problem was Indochina. There, the French Army was<br>
          uncompromising and Communist leadership was skillful. As a

          southward from Chinese Yunnan. These rivers fan out into
          fertile<br>
          alluvial deltas which produce surplus foods for undemanding
          peoples.<br>

          Indochina brought considerable wealth to France. After the<br>
          Japanese withdrawal, the Paris government was reluctant to see
          this<br>
          wealth, chiefly from the tin mines, fall into native groups
          and by<br>
          1949, decided to use force to recover the area.<br>
          <br>
          Opposed to the French effort was Ho Chi Minh, a member of the<br>
          French Communist Party. Ho had set up a coalition government
          under his<br>
          Viet Minh Party and proclaimed independence for Vietnam
          (chiefly<br>
          Tonkin and Annam) in 1945, while French troops, in a surprise
          coup,<br>
          seized Saigon in the south. Ho received no support from the
          Kremlin.<br>
          At first, Ho sought support from the United States but after
          the<br>
          establishment of Red China in 1949, he turned to that new
          Communist<br>
          state for help. Mao's government was the first state to give
          Vietnam<br>
          diplomatic recognition (January 1950) and at once began to
          send<br>
          military supplies and guidance. Since the U.S. was granting
          extensive<br>
          aid to France, the struggle in Vietnam became, through
          surrogates, a<br>
          struggle between the United States and China. In world
          opinion, this<br>
          made the U.S. the defender of European imperialism against
          anticolonial<br>
          native nationalism.<br>
          <br>
          During this turmoil, independent neutralist governments came
          into<br>
          existence in Laos and Cambodia. Both states accepted aid from
          whoever<br>
          would give it and both were ruled by an unstable balance of
          pro-<br>
          Communists, neutralists, and pro-Westerners, all with armed<br>
          supporters. On the whole, the neutralist group was largest and
          the<br>
          pro-Western was the smallest but could obtain support from
          America's<br>
          wealth. The decisive influence was that the Communists were
          prepared<br>
          to accept and support neutralism years before Dulles would
          condone it.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1044<br>
          <br>
          The readiness of Dulles and the French Army to force a
          showdown<br>
          in Vietnam was unacceptable to the British and many in France.
          Out of<br>
          this came a Soviet suggestion for a conference on Indochina in
          Geneva.<br>
          By early 1954, the Communist guerrillas were in control of
          most<br>
          of northern Indochina, were threatening Laos, and were
          plaguing<br>
          villages as far south as Saigon. About 200,000 French troops
          and<br>
          300,000 Vietnamese militia were tied in knots by about 335,000
          Viet<br>
          Minh guerrillas. France was being bled to death with nothing
          to show<br>
          for it.<br>
          <br>
          By the end of March 1953, the outer defences of the French
          strong<br>
          point at Dien Bien Phu were crumbling. The French chief of
          staff found<br>
          Dulles ready to risk all-out war with Red China by authorizing
          direct<br>
          American intervention in Indochina. As usual, Dulles thought
          that<br>
          wonders could be achieved by air strikes alone against the
          besiegers<br>
          of Dien Bien Phu and for a few day, at Dulles' prodding, the
          United<br>
          States tottered "on the brink of war." Dulles proposed "a
          united<br>
          action policy:" "If Britain would join the United States and
          France<br>
          would agree to stand firm, the three Western states could
          combine with<br>
          friendly asian nations to oppose communist forces.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1045<br>
          <br>
          President Eisenhower agreed but his calls to Churchill and
          Eden<br>
          found the British government opposed to the adventure because
          the<br>
          Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1950 bound Russia to come to the
          assistance of<br>
          China if it were attacked by the United States as Dulles
          contemplated.<br>
          During the 1954 Far Eastern Geneva Conference, two American<br>
          aircraft carriers, loaded with atomic weapons, were cruising
          the South<br>
          China Sea, awaiting orders from Washington to hurl their
          deadly bombs<br>
          at the Communist forces besieging the 15,000 exhausted troops
          trapped<br>
          at Dien Bien Phu. In Washington, Admiral Radford was
          vigorously<br>

          <br>
          advocating such aggressive action on a generally reluctant
          government.<br>
          In Paris, public outrage was rising over Indochina where the
          French<br>
          had expended 19,000 lives and $8 billion without improving
          matters a<br>
          particle. The fall of Dien Bien Phy on May 7th led to the fall
          of the<br>
          French government. The new prime minister promised a
          cease-fire or his<br>
          own retirement within 30 days. He barely met the deadline.<br>
          <br>
          The Indochinese settlement of July 20, 1954 was basically a<br>
          compromise, some of whose elements did not appear in the
          agreement<br>
          itself. A Communist North Vietnam state was recognized north
          of the<br>
          17th parallel and the rest was left in three states: Laos,
          Cambodia<br>
          and South Vietnam.<br>
          <br>
          The new state system was brought within the Dulles network of<br>
          trip-wire pacts on September 8, 1954 when Britain, France,
          Australia,<br>
          New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, Philippines and the U.S.
          formed the<br>
          South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and extended their<br>
          protection to Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam.<br>
          <br>
          The Geneva agreement was to neutralize the Indochina states
          but<br>
          was apparently not acceptable to the Dulles brothers and any
          possible<br>
          stability in the area was soon destroyed by their activities,<br>
          especially through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
          seeking to<br>
          subvert the neutrality of Laos and South Vietnam by channeling<br>
          millions in American funds to Right-wing army officers,
          building up<br>
          large military forces, rigging elections, and backing
          reactionary<br>
          coups d'etat.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1046<br>
          <br>
          These techniques might have been justified in the eyes of the
          CIA<br>
          if they had been successful but, on the contrary, they
          alienated the<br>
          mass of the natives in the area, brought numerous recruits to
          the<br>
          Left, gave justification for Communist intervention from North<br>
          Vietnam, disgusted our allies in Britain, France, Burma, India
          and<br>
          elsewhere, and by 1962 had almost destroyed the American image
          and<br>
          position in the area.<br>
          <br>
          In Laos, the chief political figure was Prince Phouma, leader
          of<br>
          the neutralist group, who tried to keep a balance between the<br>
          Communist Pathet Lao on his Left and the American-subsidized<br>
          politicians and militarists led by General Nosavan on his
          Right.<br>
          American aid was about $40 million a year of which about $36
          million<br>
          went to the army. This was used, under American influence, as
          an antineutralist<br>
          rather than an anti-Leftist influence culminating in a<br>
          bungled army attack on two Pathet Lao battalions in 1959 and
          openly<br>
          rigged elections in which all the Assembly seats were won by
          Rightwing<br>
          candidates in 1960. In August 1960, an open revolt in behalf
          of<br>
          the neutralist Phouma game rise to a Right-wing revolution led
          by<br>
          General Nosavan. This drove the neutralists in the arms of the
          Pathet<br>
          Lao.<br>
          <br>
          The SEATO Council refused to support the American position,
          the<br>
          Laotian army was reluctant to fight, and the American military
          mission<br>
          was soon involved in the confused fighting directly.<br>
          The American bungle in Laos was repeated, with variations,<br>
          elsewhere in southern and southeastern Asia. In South Vietnam,<br>
          American aid, largely military, amounted to about two thirds
          of the<br>
          country's budget, and by 1962, it had reached $2 billion. Such
          aid,<br>
          which provided little benefit for the people, corrupted the<br>
          government, weakened the swollen defense forces, and set up a
          chasm<br>
          between the rulers and people which drove the best of the
          latter<br>
          Leftward, in spite of the exploitative violence of the
          Communist<br>
          guerrillas. A plebiscite in 1955 was so rigged that the
          Americansupported<br>
          candidate won over 98% of the vote. The election of 1960 was<br>
          similarly managed, except in Saigon, the capital, where many
          people<br>
          refused to vote. As might have been expected, denial of a fair
          ballot<br>

          led to efforts to assassinate the American-sponsored
          President, Diem,<br>
          and gave rise to widespread discontent which made it possible
          for the<br>
          Communist guerrillas to operate throughout the country. The
          Americansponsored<br>
          military response drove casualties to a high sustained<br>
          figure by 1962 and was uprooting peasantry throughout the
          country in<br>
          an effort to establish fortified villages which the British
          had<br>
          introduced with success in Malaya.<br>

          <br>
          These errors of American policy, which were repeated in other<br>
          places, arose very largely from two factors:<br>
          <br>
          1) American ignorance of local conditions which were passed
          over in<br>
          animosity against Russia and China;<br>
          <br>
          2) American insistence on using military force to overcome
          local<br>
          neutralism which the mass of Asiatic people wanted.<br>
          The American militarization of both Thailand and South Vietnam<br>
          was used to increase pressure on Cambodia which was driven to
          seek<br>
          support for its independence from China and Russia.<br>
          North Vietnam had a deficiency of food while South Vietnam,
          like<br>
          all delta areas, is a zone of rice surplus and thus a shining
          target<br>
          for North Vietnamese aggression.<br>
          The collapse of the world price of rice at the end of the
          Korean<br>
          War left Burma with an unsellable surplus of almost two
          million tons.<br>
          Within the next three years, Burma signed barter agreements
          with Red<br>
          China and Soviet Europe by which Burma got rid of a third of
          its<br>
          surplus each year in return for Communist goods and technical<br>
          assistance. These returns were so poor in quality, high in
          price and<br>
          poorly shipped that Burma refused to renew the agreements in
          1958.<br>
          <br>
          SOUTHERN ASIA<br>
          <br>
          Farther west, in southern Asia (correctly called the Middle
          East<br>
          from the Persian Gulf to Burma) American bungling also opened
          may<br>
          opportunities for Soviet penetration which the Soviets failed
          to<br>
          exploit.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1048<br>
          <br>
          India was determined to be neutral; Pakistan was willing to be
          an<br>
          ally of the United States.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1049<br>
          <br>
          The partition of India before independence in 1947, as in<br>
          Palestine and earlier in Ireland, received strong impetus from
          the<br>
          Round Table Group, and in all three cases, it led to horrors
          of<br>
          violence. In India's case, the partition was a butchery rather
          than a<br>
          surgical process. Imposed by the British, it cut off two areas
          in<br>
          northwestern and northeastern India to form a new Muslim state
          of<br>
          Pakistan (cutting right through the Sikhs in the process). The
          two new<br>
          nations began under two new leaders. In the post-partition
          confusion,<br>
          minorities on the wrong sides of the lines sought to flee, as<br>
          refugees, to India or Pakistan, while the Sikhs sought to
          establish a<br>
          new homeland by exterminating Muslims in East Punjab. In a few
          weeks,<br>
          almost 200,000 were killed and twelve million were forced to
          flee as<br>
          refugees.<br>
          <br>
          The two sections of Pakistan were separated from each other by<br>
          1,100 miles of India territory, its boundaries irrational, its<br>
          economic foundations torn to shreds by the partition.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1050<br>
          <br>
          In 1958, martial law was established and General Khan became<br>
          president. Under military rule, a sweeping land-reform program<br>
          restricted owners to 500 irrigated or 1000 non-irrigated acres
          with<br>
          the surplus distributed to existing tenants or other peasants.
          Former<br>
          landlords received compensation in long-term bonds.<br>

          The American insistence on the non-committed nations adopting<br>
          anti-Soviet lines opened the way for the Soviet to pose as the
          friend<br>

          At the end of World War II, about 80 percent of Iran's
          population<br>
          were peasants. Four fifths of the land was almost entirely
          useless,<br>
          being either mountainous or arid. Moreover, the peasants who
          tilled<br>
          the land were much oppressed by heavy rents to absentee
          landlords who<br>
          also controlled, as separate rights, essential access to
          water. Only<br>
          about a seventh of the land was owned by peasants who worked
          it.<br>
          Peasants retained little more than a fifth of what they
          produced.<br>
          The shah has shifted the basis of his support from the elite<br>
          landed group to this growing middle class.<br>
          <br>
          Before 1914, the shah sought to raise funds for his personal
          use<br>
          by selling concessions and monopolies to foreign groups. Most
          of these<br>
          were exploitive of the Iranian peoples. Of these, the most
          important<br>
          was the concession for petroleum which came into possession of
          the new<br>
          Anglo-Persian Oil Company which came to be controlled, through
          secret<br>
          stock ownership, by the British government.<br>

          <br>
          At the end of World War I, Iran was a battleground between<br>
          Russian and British armed forces. By 1920, the withdrawal of
          British<br>
          forces left the anti-Bolshevik Russian Cossack Brigade as the
          only<br>
          significant military force in the country. The chief Iranian
          officer<br>
          in that force, Reza Pahlavi, in the course of 1921-1925
          gradually took<br>
          over control of the government and eventually deposed the
          incompetent<br>
          28-year-old Shah Ahmad.<br>
          <br>
          Pahlavi's chief aim was to break down tribalism and localism.
          To<br>
          this end, he defeated the autonomous tribes, settled nomadic
          groups in<br>
          villages, shifted provincial boundaries to break up local
          loyalties,<br>
          created a national civil service and police force, established<br>
          national registration with identity cards for all, and used
          universal<br>
          conscription to mingle various groups in a national army.<br>
          All these projects needed money and the chief resource, oil,
          was<br>
          tied up completely in the concession held by the AIOC with the<br>
          inevitable result that it became the target of the Iranian
          nationalist<br>
          desire for traditional development funds. The older Iranian
          elite<br>
          would have been satisfied with a renegotiated deal but the
          newer urban<br>
          groups demanded the complete removal of foreign economic
          influence by<br>
          nationalization of the petroleum industry.<br>
          <br>

          By 1950, the Shah put his prime minister in to force through
          the<br>
          supplemental agreement. Opposing groups introduced
          nationalization<br>
          bills. Gradually, the nationalization forces began to coalesce
          about a<br>
          strange figure, Mr. Muhammad Mossadegh, with a doctorate in
          Economics.<br>
          Politically, he was a moderate but his strong emotional appeal
          to<br>
          Iranian nationalism encouraged extreme reactions among his
          followers.<br>
          The company insisted that its status was based on a
          contractual<br>
          agreement which could not be modified without its consent. The
          British<br>
          government maintained the agreement was a matter of
          international<br>
          public law which it had a right to enforce. The Iranian
          government<br>
          declared it had the right to nationalize an Iranian
          corporation<br>
          operating under its law on its territory, subject only to
          adequate<br>
          compensation.<br>
          <br>
          The nationalist arguments against the company were numerous:<br>
          <br>
          1) It had promised to train Iranians for all positions
          possible but<br>
          had only used them in menial tasks, trained few natives and
          employed<br>
          many foreigners.<br>
          <br>
          2) The company had reduced its payments to Iran, which were
          based on<br>
          profits, by reducing the amount of its profits by bookkeeping
          tricks.<br>
          It sold oil at very low prices to wholly-owned subsidiaries
          outside<br>
          Iran or to the British Navy, allowing the former to resell at
          world<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          prices so that AIOC made small profits, while the subsidiaries
          made<br>
          large profits not subject to the Iranian royalty obligations.
          Iran<br>
          believe that all profits should fall under the obligations.
          but as<br>
          late as 1950, AIOC admitted that the accounts of 59 such dummy<br>
          corporations were not included in AIOC accounts.<br>
          <br>
          3) AIOC generally refused to pay Iranian taxes, especially
          income tax<br>
          but paid such taxes to Britain; at the same time, it
          calculated the<br>
          Iranian profit royalties after such taxes so that the higher
          British<br>
          taxes went, the less the Iranian payment became. Thus, Iran
          paid<br>
          income tax to Britain. In 1933, AIOC paid #305,000 in British
          taxation<br>
          and #274,000 in Iranian taxes. In 1948, the two figures were
          #28.3<br>
          million to Britain and #1.4 million to Iran.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1057<br>
          <br>
          4) The payment to Iran was also reduced by putting profits
          into<br>
          reserves or into company investments outside Iran, often in<br>
          subsidiaries, and calculating the Iranian share only on the
          profits<br>
          distributed as dividends. Thus in 1947, when profits were
          really #40.5<br>
          million, almost #15 million went to British income taxes, over
          #7<br>
          million to stockholders, and only #7 million to Iran. If the
          payment<br>
          to Iran had been calculated before taxes and reserves, it
          would have<br>
          received at least #6 million more that year.<br>
          <br>
          5) AIOC's exemption from Iranian customs deprived Iran of
          about #6<br>
          million a year.<br>
          <br>
          6) The company drew many persons to arid and uninhabited areas
          and<br>
          then provided very little of the costs of housing, education,
          or<br>
          health.<br>
          <br>
          7) AIOC as a member of the international oil cartel reduced
          its oil<br>
          production and thus reduced Iran's royalties.<br>
          <br>
          8) AIOC continued to calculate its payments to Iran in gold at
          #8.1<br>
          per ounce for years after the world gold price had risen to
          #13 an<br>
          ounce while the American Aramco in Saudi Arabia raised its
          gold price<br>
          on demand.<br>
          <br>
          9) AIOC's monopoly prevented Iran developing other Iranian oil
          fields.<br>
          As a consequence of all these activities, the Iranian<br>
          nationalists of 1952 felt angered to think that Iran had given
          up 300<br>
          million tons of oil over fifty years and obtained about #800
          million<br>
          in profits.<br>
          <br>
          The Iranian opposition to nationalization was broken in 1951
          when<br>
          the prime minister was assassinated. The nationalization bill
          was<br>
          passed and at the request of the Majlis, the shah appointed
          Mossadegh<br>
          prime minister to carry it out. This was done with
          considerable<br>
          turmoil which included strikes by AIOC workers against
          mistimed<br>
          British wage cuts, anti-British street riots and the arrival
          of<br>
          British gun-boats at the head of the Persian Gulf. Rather than
          give up<br>
          the enterprise or operate it for the Iranian government, AIOC
          began to<br>
          curtail operations and ship home its engineers. In May 1951,
          it<br>
          appealed to the International Court of Justice in spite of
          Iranian<br>
          protests that the case was a domestic one, not international.
          Only in<br>
          July, 1952, did the court's decision uphold Iran's contention
          by<br>
          refusing jurisdiction.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1058<br>
          <br>
          At first, the U.S. supported Iran's position fearing British<br>
          recalcitrance would push Iran toward Russia. However it soon
          became<br>
          apparent that the Soviet Union, while supporting Iran's
          position, was<br>
          not going to interfere. The American position then became
          increasingly<br>
          pro-British and anti-Mossadegh. This was intensified by
          pressure from<br>
          the international petroleum cartel comprising the seven
          greatest oil<br>
          companies in the world.<br>
          <br>
          As soon as Britain lost its case in the International Court of<br>
          Justice, it put into effect a series of reprisals against Iran
          which<br>
          rapidly crippled the country. Iranian funds were blocked; its<br>
          <br>

          purchases in British controlled markets were interrupted; its
          efforts<br>
          to sell oil abroad were frustrated by a combination of the
          British<br>
          Navy and the world oil cartel (which closed sales and
          distribution<br>
          facilities to Iranian oil). These cut off a substantial
          portion of the<br>
          Iranian government's revenues and forced a drastic curtailment
          of<br>
          government expenditures.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1059<br>
          <br>
          Mossadegh broke off diplomatic relations with the British,<br>
          deported various economic and cultural groups, and dismissed
          both the<br>
          Senate and the Iranian Supreme Court which were beginning to
          question<br>
          his actions.<br>
          <br>
          By that time, almost irresistible forces were building up
          against<br>
          Mossadegh, since lack of Soviet interference gave the West
          full<br>
          freedom of action. The British, the AIOC, the world petroleum
          cartel,<br>
          the American government and the older Iranian elite led by the
          shah<br>
          combined to crush Mossadegh. The chief effort came from the
          CIA under<br>
          the personal direction of Allen Dulles, brother of the
          Secretary of<br>
          State. Dulles, a former director of the Schroeder Bank in New
          York. It<br>
          will be remembered that the Schroeder Bank in Cologne helped
          to<br>
          arrange Hitler's accession to power as chancellor in January
          1933.<br>
          In the Near East, the mobs are easily roused and directed by<br>
          those who are willing to pay and Dulles had the unlimited
          secret funds<br>
          of the CIA. From these he gave $10 million to Colonel H.
          Norman<br>
          Schwartzkopf who was in charge of training the Imperial
          Iranian<br>
          Gendarmerie and this was judiciously applied in ways which
          changed the<br>
          mobs tune. The whole operation was directed personally by
          Dulles from<br>
          Switzerland.<br>
          <br>
          In August Mossadegh held a plebiscite to approve his policies.<br>
          The official vote was about two million approvals against
          twelve<br>
          hundred disapprovals but his days were numbered. On August
          13th, the<br>
          Shah precipitated the planned anti-Mossadegh coup by naming
          General<br>
          Zahedi as prime minister and sent a messenger dismissing
          Mossadegh.<br>
          The latter refused to yield and called his supporters into the
          streets<br>
          where they rioted against the Shah who fled with his family to
          Rome.<br>
          Two days later, anti-Mossadegh mobs, supported by the army,
          defeated<br>
          Mossadegh supporters. He was forced out of office and replaced
          by<br>
          General Sahedi. The shah returned from Italy on August 22nd.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1060<br>
          <br>
          The fall of Mossadegh ended the period of confusion. From 1953<br>
          on, the shah and the army, backed by the conservative elite,<br>
          controlled the country and the docile Majlis. Two weeks after
          the<br>
          shah's countercoup, the U.S. gave Iran an emergency grant of
          $45<br>
          million, increased its economic aid payment to $23 million and
          began<br>
          to pay $5 million a month in Mutual Security funds. In return,
          Iran<br>
          became a firm member of the Western bloc. The Communist Tudeh
          Party<br>
          was relentlessly pursued after 1953.<br>
          <br>
          By 1960, the shah tried a program of agrarian reform which
          sought<br>
          to restrict each landlord's holdings to a single village,
          taking all<br>
          excess lands for payments spread over 10 years and granting
          the lands<br>
          to the peasants who worked them for payments over 15 years.
          The shah's<br>
          own estates were among the first to be distributed but by the
          end of<br>
          1962 over 5000 villages had been granted to their peasants.<br>
          In the meantime, the oil dispute was settled and the incomes
          to<br>
          Iran were considerably increased averaging about $250 million
          or more<br>
          a year.<br>

          Dulles refused to recognize the right of anyone to be neutral
          and<br>
          tried to force all states to join the American side of the
          Cold War or<br>
          be condemned to exterior darkness.<br>

          The so-called "missile gap" was a mistaken idea for the U.S.
          was<br>
          in a condition of "nuclear plenty" and of "overkill capacity"
          that<br>
          posed a serious problem for the Soviet Union. It was,
          strangely<br>
          enough, just at that time (end of 1957) that two American
          studies (the<br>
          Gaither Report and the Special Studies Project of the
          Rockefeller<br>
          Brothers Fund) suggested the existence of a missile gap or
          inferiority<br>
          in missile capacity of the United States compared to the
          Soviet Union<br>
          based on the overemphasis on the "size" of Soviet rocket
          boosters. In<br>
          this pleasant period of self-deception, the Soviet Union
          entered upon<br>
          an unofficial international suspension of nuclear bomb testing
          from<br>
          1958 until 1961.<br>

          As a result of NASA's $5 billion budget, the educational
          system<br>
          was brought into the tempestuous atmosphere of the frantic
          American<br>
          marketplace and was being ransacked from the highest levels
          down to<br>
          high school and even below for talented, trained, or merely
          eager<br>
          people. As the demands for such people grew and their
          remunerations<br>
          and opportunities increased, the substantial minority who were
          not<br>
          talented, trained or eager found fewer and fewer opportunities
          to make<br>
          a living and began to sink downward toward a steadily growing
          lower<br>
          class of social outcasts and underprivileged, the socially
          selfperpetuating<br>
          group of the impoverished.<br>

          In 1959, Red China began making increasingly unfavorable
          comments<br>
          about Khrushchev's doctrines of "peaceful coexistence with
          capitalism"<br>
          and the "inevitable victory of Socialism without war." He
          ruled out<br>
          the need for war and the Soviet Union was willing to reach
          complete<br>
          disarmament supervised by mutual controls including aerial<br>
          photography.<br>

          As late as 1960, only 38,000 man-days of labor were lost by<br>
          strikes and lockouts in West Germany compared to almost half a
          million<br>
          in the Netherlands, 3 million in the U.K. and 19 million in
          the U.S.<br>
          In Germany in 1958, eight great trusts still controlled 75<br>
          percent of crude steel production, 80 percent of raw iron, 60
          percent<br>
          of rolled steel, and 36 percent of coal output.<br>
          The ten percent increase each year in the West German gross<br>
          national product was something that could not be denied or<br>
          disbelieved.<br>

          In East Germany in 1960, almost a million farmers were forced<br>
          into less than 20,000 collective farms by methods of violence
          and<br>
          social pressure similar to those Stalin had used. And the
          consequences<br>
          were similar: agricultural production collapsed. Shortages of
          food<br>
          were soon followed by other shortages.<br>

          Khrushchev's talk about "peaceful co-existence" was sincere

          he sincerely wished to divert the Communist-Capitalist
          struggle into<br>
          non-violent areas. Thus he was sincere in his disarmament
          suggestions.<br>

          Metternich said, "A diplomat is a man who never allows himself<br>
          the pleasure of a triumph," and does so simply because it is
          to the<br>
          interest of the stronger that an opponent who recognizes the
          victor's<br>
          strength and is reasonable in yielding to it not be overthrown
          or<br>
          replaced by another ruler who is too ignorant or too
          unreasonable to<br>
          do so.<br>

          After Russia backed down on the Cuban missile crisis, the
          White<br>
          House received a long and confused letter from Khrushchev
          whose tone<br>
          clearly showed his personal panic and, to save his reputation,
          it was<br>
          not released to the public. The next morning, the Soviet
          Foreign<br>
          Office published a quite different text, suggesting that a
          deal be<br>
          made dismantling both the American missile sites in Turkey and
          the<br>
          Soviet missile sites in Cuba. To those inside both
          governments, this<br>
          was recognized as a Soviet surrender since they knew that the
          Turkish<br>
          sites were obsolete and were already scheduled to be
          dismantled. It<br>
          was rejected by the White House because it would have
          represented to<br>
          the world a surrender of Turkey. Instead, the White House
          replied to<br>
          an offer to remove the Russian missiles if we would lift the
          blockade<br>
          and promise not to invade Cuba.<br>

          The Brazilian cost of living rose 40% in 1961, 50% in 1962,

          Latin America is not only poverty-ridden but the distribution
          of<br>
          wealth and income is so unequal that the most ostentatious
          luxury<br>
          exists for a small group side by side with the most degrading
          poverty<br>
          for the overwhelming majority. Four fifths of the population
          of Latin<br>
          America get about $53 a year, while a mere 100 families own
          90% of the<br>
          native-owned wealth of the whole area and only 30 families own
          72% of<br>
          that wealth. In Brazil, half of all and is owned by 2.6% of
          the<br>
          landowners while 22.5% is owned by only 1/2% of the owners. In
          Latin<br>
          America, at least two thirds of the land is owned by 10% of
          the<br>
          families.<br>

          While such conditions may rouse North American to outrage or<br>
          humanitarian sympathy, no solution can be found by emotion or<br>
          sentimentality. The problems are not based on lack of anything
          but on<br>
          structural weaknesses. Solutions will not rest on anything
          that can be<br>
          done to or for individual people but on the arrangements of
          peoples.<br>
          Latin American lacks the outlook that will mobilize its
          resources in<br>
          constructive rather than destructive directions.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, the birthrate must decrease or the food supply must
          be<br>
          increased faster than the population. And some provision must
          be made<br>
          to provide peasants with capital and know-how before the great
          landed<br>
          estates are divided up among them. A more productive
          organization of<br>
          resources should have priority over any effort to raise
          standards of<br>
          living.<br>

          less than the need for utilization of Latin America's own
          capital and<br>
          know-how. The wealth and income of Latin America, in absolute<br>
          quantities, is so great and it is so inequitably controlled
          and<br>
          distributed that there is an enormous accumulation of incomes,
          far<br>
          beyond their consumption needs, in the hands of a small
          percentage of<br>
          Latin Americans. Much of these excess incomes are wasted,
          hoarded, or<br>
          merely used for wasteful competition in ostentatious social
          display<br>
          largely due to the deficiencies of Latin American
          personalities and<br>
          character.<br>
          <br>
          The solution is not to redistribute incomes but to change the<br>
          patterns of character and of personality formation so that
          excess<br>
          incomes will be used constructively and not wasted.<br>

          At least half the value of American aid has been wiped away by<br>
          the worsening of Latin America's terms of trade which made it<br>
          necessary for it to pay more and more for its imports at the
          same time<br>
          that it got less and less for its exports made worse by much
          of the<br>
          available supply of foreign exchange spent for self-indulgent
          and non<br>
          constructive spending abroad or simply to hoard their money in
          New<br>
          York, London or Switzerland. The solution must be found in
          more<br>
          responsible, more public-spirited, and more constructive
          patterns of<br>
          outlook, of money flows, and of political and social security.
          A<br>
          similar solution must be found for social deficiencies like
          inadequate<br>
          housing, education, and social stability.<br>

          An Asian despotism is a two-class society in which a lower

          consisting of nine tenths of the population supports an upper

          class consisting of a governing bureaucracy of scribes and
          priests<br>
          associated with army leaders, landlords, and moneylenders. The<br>
          essential character of an Asian despotism rests on the fact
          that the<br>
          ruling class has legal claim on the working masses and
          possesses the<br>
          power to enforce these claims.<br>

          World War II, by increasing demand for Latin America's mineral<br>
          and agricultural products, pushed starvation and controversy
          away from<br>
          the immediate present. Latin American boomed: the rich got
          richer; the<br>
          poor had more children. A few poor became rich, or at least
          richer.<br>
          But nothing was done to modify the basic pattern of Latin
          American<br>
          power, wealth, and outlook.<br>

          Until the 1952 revolution, the Bolivians, mostly of Indian<br>
          descent, who were treated as second-class persons working as<br>
          semislaves in the mines or as serfs on the large estates, had
          a per<br>
          capita annual outcome of about $100. As might be expected, the<br>
          majority were illiterate, sullen and discouraged.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1128<br>
          <br>
          The Junta was overthrown in 1952. Paz Estenssoro returned from<br>
          exile to become president. Pressure from the tin miners and
          from the<br>
          peasants forced the new regime to nationalize the mines and to
          break<br>
          up many of the large estates. Production costs of tin rose
          above<br>
          market price thus wiping out their foreign exchange earnings.
          Worse,<br>
          the world price of tin collapsed in 1957.<br>
          <br>
          The problems could hardly be handled because of popular
          pressures<br>
          in a democratic country to live beyond the country's income.
          The final<br>
          collapse did not occur because of the efforts of President
          Siles and<br>
          assistance from the United States.<br>

          If any proof were needed that radical reform for sharing the<br>
          wealth of the few among the many poor is not an easy, or
          feasible<br>
          method, Bolivia's hard-working Indians, once hopelessly dull,
          morose,<br>
          and sullen, are not bright, hopeful, and self-reliant. Even
          their<br>
          clothing is gradually shifting from the older funereal black
          to<br>
          brighter colors and variety.<br>
          <br>
          Few contrasts could be more dramatic than that between the<br>
          Bolivian revolutionary government (in which a moderate regime
          was<br>
          pushed toward radicalism by popular pressures and survived,
          year after<br>
          year, with American assistance) and the Guatemala revolution
          where a<br>
          Communist-inspired regime tried to lead a rather inert
          population in<br>
          the direction of increasing radicalism but was overthrown by
          direct<br>
          American action within three years (1951-1954).<br>
          <br>
          Guatemala is one of the "banana republics." The retail value
          of<br>
          Latin America's part of the world's trade in bananas is
          several<br>
          billion dollars a year but Latin America's gets less than 7%
          of that<br>
          value. One reason for this is the existence of the United
          Fruit<br>
          Company which owns two million acres of plantations in six
          countries<br>
          and handles about a third of the world's banana sales. It pays
          about<br>
          $145 million a year into the six countries and claims to earn
          about<br>
          $26 million profits on its $159 million investment but this
          profit<br>
          figure of about 16.6% is undoubtedly far below the true
          figure. In<br>
          1970, 95% of the land held by United Fruit was uncultivated.<br>
          <br>

          Guatemala, like Bolivia, has a population that consists
          largely<br>
          of impoverished Indians and mixed bloods (mestizos). From 1931
          to 1944<br>
          it was ruled by the dictator Jorge Ubico, the last of a long
          line of<br>
          corrupt and ruthless tyrants. When he retired to New Orleans
          in 1944,<br>
          free elections chose Juan Jose Arevalo (1945-1950) and Jacobo
          Arbenz<br>
          Guzman (1950-1954) as presidents. Reform was long overdue and
          these<br>
          two administrations tried to provide it, becoming increasingly
          anti-<br>
          American and pro-Communist over their nine-year rule. When
          they began,<br>
          civil or political rights were almost totally unknown and 142
          persons<br>
          (including corporations) owned 98% of the arable land. Free
          speech and<br>
          press, legalized unions, and free elections preceded the work
          of<br>
          reform but opposition from the United States began as soon as
          it<br>

          became clear that the Land Reform Act of June 1952 would be
          applied to<br>
          the United Fruit Company. This act called for redistribution
          of<br>
          uncultivated holdings above a fixed acreage or lands of
          absentee<br>
          owners, with compensation from the twenty year 3 percent bonds
          equal<br>
          to the tax value of the lands. About 400,000 acres of United
          Fruit<br>
          lands fell under this law and were distributed by the Arbenz
          Guzman<br>
          government to 180,000 peasants. This was declared to be a
          Communist<br>
          penetration by Allen Dulles, Director of the CIA, which soon
          found an<br>
          American-trained and American-financed Guatemalan Colonel,
          Carlos<br>
          Castillo Armas, who was prepared to lead a revolt against
          Arbenz. With<br>
          American money and equipment, and even some American
          "volunteers" to<br>
          fly "surplus" American planes, Armas mounted an attack of
          Guatemalan<br>
          exiles from bases in two adjacent dictatorships, Honduras and<br>
          Nicaragua." Both these countries are horrible examples of
          everything a<br>
          Latin American government should not be, corrupt, tyrannical,
          cruel,<br>
          and reactionary, but they won the favor of the United States
          State<br>
          Department by echoing American foreign policy at every turn.<br>
          Nicaragua, often a target of American intervention in the
          past, was<br>
          decayed, dirty, and diseased under the twenty-year tyranny of<br>
          Anastasio Somoza (1936-1956). His assassination handed the
          country<br>
          over to be looted by his two sons, one of whom became
          president while<br>
          the other served as commander of the National Guard.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1131<br>
          <br>
          From these despotic bases, the CIA-directed assault of Colonel<br>
          Armas overthrew Arbenz Guzman in 1954 and established in
          Guatemala a<br>
          regime similar to that of the Somozas. All civil and political<br>
          freedoms were overthrown, the land reforms were undone, and
          corruption<br>
          reigned. When Armas was assassinated in 1957 and a moderate
          elected as<br>
          his successor, the army annulled those elections and held new
          ones in<br>
          which one of their own, General Fuentes, was "elected." He
          liquidated<br>
          what remained of Guatemala's Socialist experiments by granting
          these<br>
          enterprises, at very reasonable prices, to his friends while<br>
          collecting his own pay of a $1 million a year. Discontent from
          his<br>
          associates led to a conservative army revolt but American
          pressure<br>
          secured his position. The U.S. could not afford a change of
          regime<br>
          since that country was the chief aggressive base for the Cuban
          exiles'<br>
          attack on Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1962.<br>
          <br>
          The CIA success in attacking "Communist" Guatemala from<br>
          dictatorial Nicaragua in 1954 was not repeated in its more
          elaborate<br>
          attack on "Communist" Cuba from dictatorial Guatemala in 1962.
          In<br>
          fact, the Bay of Pigs must stand as the most shameful event in
          U.S.<br>
          history since the end of World War II.<br>
          <br>
          The causes of the Cuban disaster, if we oversimplify, may be<br>
          organized in terms of two intersecting factors:<br>
          <br>
          1) the personality deficiencies of the Cubans themselves such
          as their<br>
          lack of rationality and self-discipline, their emotionalism
          and<br>
          corruptibility;<br>
          <br>
          2) the ignorance and ineptitude of the American State
          Department which<br>
          seems incapable of dealing with Latin America in terms of the
          real<br>
          problems of the area but instead insists on treating it in
          terms of<br>
          America's vision of the world, which is to day, America's
          political<br>
          preconceptions and economic interests.<br>
          <br>
          Cuba is more Spanish than much of Latin America and only
          obtained<br>
          its independence in 1898, two generations later than the rest
          of Latin<br>
          America. Then, for over thirty years, until the abrogation of
          the<br>
          Platt Amendment in 1934, Cuba was under American occupation or
          the<br>
          threat of direct American intervention. It fell under American<br>
          economic domination by American investments on the island and
          by<br>
          becoming deeply involved in the american market, especially
          for sugar.<br>
          A local oligarchy of Cubas was built up including an
          exploitative<br>

          landlord group that had not existed previously.<br>
          With the establishment of the Good Neighbor Policy in 1933 and<br>
          ending the threat of American direct intervention, it became
          possible<br>
          for the Cubans to overthrow the tyrannical and bloody rule of
          General<br>
          Machado which had lasted for eight years (1925-1933).<br>
          <br>
          Page 1132<br>
          The opportunity to begin a series of urgently needed and
          widely<br>
          demanded social reforms under Machado's successor, San Martin,
          was<br>
          lost when the United States refused to recognize or to assist
          the new<br>
          regime. As a result, a ruthless Cuban army sergeant, Fuegencio<br>
          Batista, was able to overthrow San Martin and begin a ten-year
          rule<br>
          through civilian puppets chosen in fraudulent elections, and
          then<br>
          directly as president himself. When San Martin was elected
          president<br>
          in 1944, he abandoned his earlier reformist ideas and became
          the first<br>
          of a series of increasingly corrupt elected regimes over the
          next<br>
          eight years. The fourth such election for 1953 was prevented
          when<br>
          Batista seized power once again in 1952.<br>
          <br>
          The next seven years were filled with Batista's efforts to
          hold<br>
          his position by violence and corruption against the rising
          tide of<br>
          discontent against his rule.<br>
          <br>
          One of the earliest episodes in that tide was an attempted
          revolt<br>
          by a handful of youths, led by 26-year-old Fidel Castro in
          eastern<br>
          Cuba on July 26, 1953. The failure of the rising gave Castro
          two years<br>
          of imprisonment and more than a year of exile but at the end
          of 1956,<br>
          he landed with a handful of men to begin guerrilla operations.<br>
          Batista's regime was so corrupt that many segments of the army
          and<br>
          middle class were neutral or favorable to Castro's operations.
          The<br>
          necessary arms and financial support came from these groups
          although<br>
          the core of the movement was made up of peasants and workers
          led by<br>
          young middle-class university students.<br>
          <br>
          This Castro uprising was not typical because of Castro's<br>
          fanatical thirst for power, his ruthless willingness to
          destroy<br>
          property or lives in order to weaken the Batista regime, and
          his<br>
          double method of operation, from within Cuba rather than from
          abroad<br>
          and from a rural base, the peasants, rather than the usual
          urban base,<br>
          the army, used by most Latin American rebels.<br>
          <br>
          On New Year's day of 1959, Castro marched into Havana. Within
          two<br>
          weeks, the supporters of the Batista regime and dissident
          elements in<br>
          Castro's movement began to be executed by firing squad.<br>
          For a year, Castro's government carried on reforms aimed at<br>
          satisfying the more obvious demands of the dispossessed
          groups.<br>
          Military barracks were converted into schools; the militia was<br>
          permanently established to replace the regular army; rural
          health<br>
          centers were set up; a full-scale attack was made on
          illiteracy; new<br>
          schools were constructed; urban rents were cut in half;
          utility rates<br>
          were slashed; taxes were imposed on the upper classes; the
          beaches,<br>
          once reserved for the rich, were opened to all; and a drastic
          land<br>
          reform was launched.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1133<br>
          <br>
          These actions were not integrated into any viable economic<br>
          program but they did spread a sense of well-being in the
          countryside<br>
          although they curtailed the building boom in the cities,
          largely<br>
          rooted in American investment, and they instigated a flight of
          the<br>
          rich from the island to refuge in the U.S.<br>
          <br>
          Castro sought to export revolution to the rest of Latin
          America.<br>
          Arms and guerrilla fighters were sent, and lost, in
          unsuccessful<br>
          efforts to invade Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican<br>
          Republic. Failure of these turned him to methods of more
          subtle<br>
          penetration, largely worked by propaganda and the arming and
          training<br>
          of small subversive groups, especially where democratic or
          progressive<br>
          regimes seemed to be developing as in Venezuela or Colombia.
          At the<br>

          <br>
          same time, an unsuccessful effort was made to persuade all
          Latin<br>
          America to form an anti-Yankee front.<br>
          <br>
          Although the U.S. had promised in 1959 to follow a policy of
          nonintervention<br>
          toward Cuba, these changes within the island and a visit<br>
          of Soviet Deputy Premier Mikoyan in February 1960 forced a<br>
          reconsideration of this policy. The Mikoyan agreement promised
          Cuba<br>
          petroleum, arms and other needs for its sugar followed by<br>
          establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in
          May and<br>
          with Red China later in the year. The Soviet embassy in Havana
          became<br>
          a source of Communist subversion for all Latin America almost
          at once,<br>
          while in September Khrushchev and Castro jointly dominated the
          annual<br>
          session of the General Assembly of the U.N. in New York.<br>
          Castro obtained petroleum for Cuban sugar. When he insisted
          that<br>
          American-owned refineries in Cuba process this oil, they
          refused and<br>
          were at once seized by Castro.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1134<br>
          <br>
          The U.S. struck back by reducing the Cuban sugar quota in the<br>
          American market which led, step by step, to Castro's sweeping<br>
          nationalization of foreign-owned factories on the island. The
          United<br>
          States retaliated by establishing a series of embargoes on
          Cuban<br>
          exports to the U.S. These controversies led Castro into an
          economic<br>
          trap similar to that into which Nasser had fallen with Egypt's
          cotton.<br>
          Each nationalist leader committed his chief
          foreign-exchange-earning<br>
          product (sugar and cotton) to the Soviet Union as payment for<br>
          Communist (often Czech) arms. This tied these countries to the
          Soviet<br>
          Union and deprived them of the chance to use their own source
          of<br>
          foreign money for equipment so urgently needed for economic<br>
          improvement. By December when American diplomatic relations
          with Cuba<br>
          were broken off, the Cuban economic decline had begun and soon
          reached<br>
          a point where standards of living were at least a third below
          the<br>
          Batista level except for some previously submerged groups.<br>
          At the end of 1960, the Eisenhower Administration decided to
          use<br>
          force to remove Castro. This decision was a major error and
          led to a<br>
          totally shameful fiasco. The error apparently arose in the CIA
          and was<br>
          based on a complete misjudgment of the apparent east with
          which that<br>
          agency had overthrown the Arbenz regime in Guatemala in 1954
          by<br>
          organizing a raid of exiles, armed and financed by the CIA,
          into<br>
          Guatemala from Nicaragua. The CIA analyzed this apparently
          successful<br>
          coup quite incorrectly,since it assumed that Arbenz had been<br>
          overthrown by the raiding exiles when he had really been
          destroyed by<br>
          his own army which used the raid as an excuse and occasion to
          get rid<br>
          of him. But on this mistaken basis, the CIA decided to get rid
          of<br>
          Castro by a similar raid of Cuban exiles from Guatemala.<br>
          This decision was worse than a crime; it was stupid. A<br>
          unilateral, violent attack on a neighboring state with which
          we were<br>
          not at war, in an area where we were committed to multilateral
          and<br>
          peaceful procedures for settling disputes, was a repudiation
          of all<br>
          our idealistic talk about the rights of small nations and our
          devotion<br>
          to peaceful procedures that we had been pontificating around
          the world<br>
          since 1914. It was a violation of our commitment to
          non-intervention<br>
          in the Americas and specifically in Cuba. In sequence to our
          CIA<br>
          intervention in Guatemala, it strengthened Latin American
          picture of<br>
          the U.S. as indifferent to Latin America's growing demand for
          social<br>
          reform.<br>
          <br>
          The whole operation, patterned on Hitler's operations to
          subvert<br>
          Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 was bungled as Hitler could
          never<br>
          have bungled anything. The project was very much a Dulles
          brothers'<br>
          job and its execution was largely in the hands of the CIA.<br>

          Hitler lines: the expeditionary force was to establish a
          beachhead in<br>
          Cuba, set up a government on the island, be recognized by the
          U.S. as<br>
          the actual government of Cuba, and ask Washington for aid to
          restore<br>
          order in the rest of the island which it did not yet control.
          The CIA<br>
          assured President Kennedy that if matters were allowed to go
          on as<br>
          they were, Castro would be strengthened in power (which was
          untrue)<br>
          and that the invasion would be success because of the Cuban
          people,<br>
          led by the anti-Castro underground, would rise against him as
          soon as<br>
          they heard of the landing.<br>
          <br>
          The executive committee of Cuban refugees in the U.S., mostly<br>
          representatives of the older ruling groups in Cuba, were eager
          to<br>
          restore the inequitable economic and social system that had
          existed<br>
          before Castro. They were alienated from the most vigorous
          anti-Castro<br>
          groups in the Cuban underground who had no desire to turn back
          the<br>
          clock to the Batista era. The CIA would not cooperate with the
          anti-<br>
          Castro underground because it was opposed to their wish for
          social and<br>
          economic reform. Accordingly, the CIA launched the invasion
          without<br>
          notifying the Cuban underground. Then the attack was bungled.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1136<br>
          <br>
          This greatly strengthened Castro's prestige in Latin American<br>
          more than in Cuba itself. This in turn permitted him to
          survive a<br>
          deepening wave of passive resistance and sabotage within Cuba
          itself,<br>
          chiefly from the peasants to recapture control of the Cuban<br>
          revolutionary movement.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1138<br>
          <br>
          In May 1961, Castro proclaimed that Cuba would be a socialist<br>
          state but despite his statements, he was not in any way a
          convinced<br>
          Communist or a convinced anything else, but was a power-hungry
          and<br>
          emotionally unstable individual, filled with hatred of
          authority<br>
          himself, and restless unless he had constant change and
          megalomaniac<br>
          satisfactions. His tactical skill, especially in foreign
          affairs, is<br>
          remarkable, and shows similarity to Hitler's.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1139<br>
          <br>
          On the whole, the role of the U.S. in Latin America has not
          been<br>
          such as to help either patterns or priorities, largely because
          our<br>
          concern has been with what seems to be useful or better for us
          rather<br>
          than with what would be most helpful to them.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1140<br>
          <br>
          Despite the enthusiasm and energy that make it possible for
          them<br>
          to overthrow corrupt and tyrannical regimes,it soon becomes
          clear that<br>
          they have little idea what to do once they get into power. As
          a<br>
          result, they fall under the personal influence of unstable and<br>
          ignorant men, the Nassers, the Perons, and the Castros who
          fall back<br>
          on emotionally charged programs of hatreds and spectacular
          displays of<br>
          unconstructive nationalism that waste time and use up
          resources while<br>
          the real problems go unsolved.<br>
          <br>
          A heavy responsibility rests with the United States for this<br>
          widespread failure to find solutions to problems all the way
          from<br>
          Pakistan to Peru. The basic reason for this is that our
          policies in<br>
          this great area have been based on efforts to find solutions
          to our<br>
          own problems rather than theirs; to make profits, to increase
          supplies<br>
          of necessary raw materials, to fight Hitler, to keep out
          Communism and<br>
          prevent the spread of neutralism. The net result is that we
          are now<br>
          more hated than the Soviet Union and neutralism reveals itself
          as<br>
          clearly as it dares through the whole area.<br>

          The sole consequence of the Dulles efforts to do the wrong
          thing<br>
          along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis has been to increase what he
          was<br>
          seeking to reduce: local political instability, increased
          Communist<br>
          and Soviet influence, neutralism, and hatred of the U.S.<br>

          American foreign policy in Latin America, the situation was
          the same,<br>
          both before and since Dulles. American policy has been
          determined by<br>
          American needs and desires and not by the problems of Latin
          Americans.<br>
          There are four chief periods in U.S. policy in Latin America
          in the<br>
          <br>
          20th century:<br>
          <br>
          1) a period of investment and interventionism (until 1933) and
          was<br>
          basically a period of American imperialism. American money
          came as<br>
          investments seeking profits out of the exploitation of the
          areas<br>
          resources. There was little respect for the people themselves
          and<br>
          intervention by American military and diplomatic forces was
          always<br>
          close at hand as a protection for American profits and
          investments.<br>
          <br>
          2) the Good Neighbor Policy in 1933 reduced intervention while<br>
          retaining investment.<br>
          <br>
          3) from 1940 until 1947, our efforts to involved the are in
          our<br>
          foreign policy against Hitler and Japan;<br>
          <br>
          4) since 1947, against the Soviet Union.<br>
          Both these efforts have been mistakes.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1142<br>
          <br>
          That this failure continued into the 1960s was clear in<br>
          Washington's joy at the military coup that ejected the
          left-of-center<br>
          Goulart government from Brazil in 1964 for that government,
          however<br>
          misdirected and incompetent, at least recognized that there
          were<br>
          urgent social and economic problems in Brazil demanding
          treatment. No<br>
          real recognition that such problems existed was achieved in
          Washington<br>
          until Castro's revolution forced the realization.<br>
          The formal agreement for the Alliance for Progress aims and<br>
          attitudes were admirable but required implementation features
          that<br>
          were not covered in the Charter itself.<br>
          <br>
          "We, the American Republics, hereby proclaim our decision to<br>
          unite in a common effort to bring our people accelerated
          economic<br>
          progress and broader social justice within the framework of
          personal<br>
          dignity and personal liberty. Almost two hundred years ago we
          began in<br>
          this hemisphere the long struggle for freedom which now
          inspires<br>
          people in all parts of the world. Now we must give a new
          meaning to<br>
          that revolutionary heritage. For America stands at a turning
          point in<br>
          history. The men and women of this hemisphere are reaching for
          the<br>
          better life which today's skills have placed within their
          grasp. They<br>
          are determined for themselves and their children to have
          decent and<br>
          ever more abundant lives, to gain access to knowledge and
          equal<br>
          opportunity for all, to end those conditions which benefit the
          few at<br>
          the expense of the needs and dignity of the many."<br>
          <br>
          Page 1144<br>
          <br>
          These were fine words but the methods for achieving these<br>
          desirable goals were only incidentally established in the
          Charter. On<br>
          the whole, it cannot be said that it has been a success. It's<br>
          achievement has been ameliorative rather than structural, and
          this<br>
          alone indicates that it has not been a success. For unless
          there are<br>
          structural reforms, its economic development will not become
          selfsustaining<br>
          or even manage to keep up with the growth of population on<br>
          the basis of income per capita.<br>
          <br>

          The failure of the Alliance for Progress to achieve what it
          was<br>
          touted to achieve was a result that it was not intended
          primarily to<br>
          be a method for achieving a better life for Latin Americans
          but was<br>
          intended to be a means of implementing American policy in the
          Cold<br>
          War. This became clearly evident at the second Punta del Este<br>
          Conference in 1962 where Washington's exclusive control over
          the<br>
          granting of funds was used as a club to force the Latin
          American<br>
          states to exclude Cuba from the Organization of American
          States. The<br>
          original plan was to cut off Cuba's trade with all Western
          Hemisphere<br>

          countries. A two-thirds vote was obtained only after the most
          intense<br>
          American "diplomatic" pressure and bribery involving the
          granting and<br>
          withholding of American aid to the Alliance. Even at that, six<br>
          countries, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and
          Ecuador,<br>
          representing 70% of Latin America's population refused to vote
          for the<br>
          American motions.<br>

          The aid takes the form not of money which can be used to buy
          the<br>
          best goods in the cheapest market but as credits which can be
          used<br>
          only in the U.S. Much of these credits goes either to fill the
          gaps in<br>
          the budgets or the foreign-exchange balances which provides
          the<br>
          maximum of leverage in getting these governments to follow
          America's<br>
          lead but provides little or no benefit to the impoverished
          peoples of<br>
          the hemisphere.<br>

          <br>
          The post-war agrarian reform redistributed the ownership of
          land<br>
          by the government taking all individual land holdings beyond
          7.5<br>
          acres, all rented land over 2.5 acres, and the land of
          absentee<br>
          landlords. The former owners were paid with long-term bonds.
          In turn,<br>
          peasants without land or with less than the maximum permitted
          amount<br>
          were allowed to buy land from the state on a long-term
          low-interestrate<br>
          basis. Cash rents for land were also lowered. As a result,
          Japan<br>
          became a land of peasant owners with about 90% of the
          cultivated land<br>
          worked by its owners.<br>

          Agrarian reform has driven Communism out of the rural areas
          and<br>
          restricted it to the cities, chiefly to student groups.<br>

          Page 1159<br>
          <br>
          Previous to the Land Reform Law of 1950, 10% of families owned<br>
          53% farm land while 32% owned 78% of the land. This left over
          two<br>
          thirds of such families with only 22% of the land. The first
          stage in<br>
          agrarian reform had been the "elimination of landlordism." The<br>
          landlords were eliminated with great brutality in a series of<br>
          spectacular public trials in which landlords were accused of
          every<br>
          crime in the book. At least 3 million were executed and
          several times<br>
          that number were imprisoned but the totals may have been much
          higher.<br>
          The land thus obtained was distributed to poor peasant
          families with<br>
          each obtaining about one-third of an acre.<br>
          <br>
          The second stage sought to establish cooperative farming. In<br>
          effect, it took away from the peasants the lands they had just<br>
          obtained. The third stage constituting the basic feature of
          the "Great<br>
          Leap Forward" merged the 750,000 collective farms into about
          26,000<br>
          agrarian communes of about 5,000 families each. This was a
          social<br>
          rather than simply an agrarian revolution since its aims
          included the<br>
          destruction of the family household and the peasant village.
          All<br>
          activities of the members, including child rearing, came under
          the<br>
          control of the commune.<br>

          The Communist government was not involved in corruption,
          selfenrichment,<br>
          and calculated inefficiency as earlier Chinese governments<br>
          were and had both greater power and greater desire to operate
          a fair<br>
          rationing system but the fact remains that the inability of
          communized<br>
          agricultural system to produce sufficient food surpluses to
          support a<br>
          communized industrial system at a high rate of expansion is
          now<br>
          confirmed and the need for all Communist regimes to purchase
          grain<br>
          from the Western countries confirms that there is something in
          the<br>
          Western pattern of living which does provide a bountiful

          A source of alienation between Moscow and Peking is concerned<br>
          with the growing recognition that the Kremlin was being driven
          toward<br>
          a policy of peaceful coexistence with the U.S. not as a
          temporary<br>
          tactical maneuver (which would have been acceptable to China)
          but as a<br>
          semipermanent policy since Marxist-Leninist theory envisioned
          the<br>
          advanced capitalist states as approaching a condition of
          economic<br>
          collapse from "the internal contradictions of capitalism
          itself." This<br>
          crisis would be reflected in two aspects: the continued
          impoverishment<br>
          of the working class with the consequent growth of the
          violence of the<br>
          class struggle in such countries and increasing violence of
          the<br>
          imperialist aggressions of such countries toward each other in<br>
          struggles to control more backward areas as markets for the
          industrial<br>
          products that the continued impoverishment of their own
          workers made<br>
          impossible to sell in domestic market. The falseness of these
          theories<br>
          was fully evident in the rising standards of living of the
          advanced<br>
          industrial countries. This evidence of the errors of
          Marxist-Leninist<br>
          theories was increasingly clear to the Kremlin, although it
          could not<br>
          be admitted, but it was quite unclear to Peking.<br>

          they are<br>
          subject to no real efforts at forcible suppression, although
          they are<br>

          the eight-year struggle ended at Geneva in 1954. The Geneva
          agreements<br>
          provided that all foreign military forces, except a French
          training<br>
          group, be withdrawn from Laos. When the Pathet Lao showed
          increased<br>
          strength in the elections of May 1958, the anti-Communist
          group<br>
          combined to oust Premier Phouma and put in the pro-Western
          Sananikone.<br>
          This government was then ejected and replaced by a Right-wing

          junta led by General Nosavan in 1960; but within seven months
          a new<br>
          coup led by Kong Le brought Phouma back to office. Four months
          later,<br>
          Nosavan once again replaced Phouma by military force. The
          Communist<br>

          The Geneva agreement of 1954 had recognized the Communist<br>

          but this imaginary line could not keep discontent or Communist<br>
          guerrillas out of South Vietnam so long as the
          American-sponsored<br>
          southern government carried on its tasks with corruption,
          favoritism<br>
          and arbitrary despotism. These growing characteristics of the
          South<br>
          Vietnam government centered around the antics of the Diem
          family.<br>
          President Diem's brother Nhu was the actual power in the

          heading up a semi-secret political organization that
          controlled all<br>

          tyranny was engaged in such pointless tasks as crushing Saigon
          high<br>
          school agitations by secret police raids or efforts to
          persecute the<br>
          overwhelming Buddhist majority and to extend favors to the
          Roman<br>
          Catholics who were less than 10% of the population.<br>
          <br>
          When Diem became president in 1955, after the deposition of
          the<br>
          pro-French Emperor Bao Dai, the country had just received
          800,000<br>
          refugees from North Vietnam which the Geneva conference had
          yielded to<br>
          Ho Chi Minh's communists, the overwhelming majority of which
          were<br>
          Roman Catholics, raising their number to over a million in a<br>
          population of 14 million. Nevertheless, Diem made these
          Catholics the<br>
          chief basis of his power, chiefly recruiting the refugees into
          various<br>
          police forces dominated by the Diem family.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1173<br>
          <br>
          By 1955, these were already beginning to persecute the
          Buddhist<br>
          majority, at first by harassing their religious festivals and
          parades<br>
          but later with brutal assaults on their meetings. An attempted
          coup by<br>
          army units was crushed and the Diem rule became increasingly<br>
          arbitrary.<br>
          <br>
          American military assistance tried to curtail the depredations
          of<br>
          the Communist guerrillas. The intensity of the guerrilla
          attacks<br>
          steadily increased following Diem's re-election with 88% of
          the vote.<br>
          American intervention was also stepped up and gradually began
          to shift<br>
          from a purely advisory and training role to increasingly
          direct<br>
          participation in the conflict. From 1961 onward, American
          casualties<br>
          averaged about one dead a week, year after year. The Communist<br>
          guerrilla casualties were reported to be about 500 per week
          but this<br>
          did not seem to diminish their total number or relax their
          attacks.<br>
          These guerrilla attacks consisted of rather purposeless<br>
          destruction of peasant homes and villages, apparently designed
          to<br>
          convince the natives of the impotence of the government and
          the<br>
          advisability of cooperating with the rebels. To stop these<br>
          depredations, the government undertook the gigantic task of
          organizing<br>
          the peasants into "agrovilles" or "strategic hamlets" which
          were to be<br>
          strongly defended residential centers entirely enclosed behind<br>
          barricades. The process, it was said, would also improve the
          economic<br>
          and social welfare of the people to give them a greater
          incentive to<br>
          resist the rebels. There was considerable doubt about the<br>
          effectiveness of the reform aspect of this process and some
          doubt<br>
          about the defence possibilities of the scheme as a whole. Most<br>
          observers felt that very little American economic aid ever
          reached the<br>
          village level but instead was lost on much higher levels. By
          the<br>
          summer of 1963, guerrillas were staging successful attacks on
          the<br>
          strategic hamlets and the need for a more active policy became
          acute.<br>

          This final crisis in the story of the Diem family and its<br>
          henchmen arose from religious persecution of the Buddhists
          under the<br>
          guise of maintaining political order. On November 1, 1963, an<br>
          American-encouraged military coup led by General Minh
          overthrew the<br>
          Diem family. A new government with a Buddhist premier calmed
          down the<br>
          domestic crisis but was no more able to suppress guerrilla
          activities.<br>

          The massive economic mobilization for World War II showed
          clearly<br>
          that there could be an equally massive post-war mobilization
          of<br>

          It is usually not recognized that the whole economic expansion
          of<br>
          Western society rests upon a number of psychological attitudes
          that<br>
          are prerequisites to the system as we have it but are not
          often stated<br>
          explicitly. Two of these may be identified as:<br>
          <br>
          1) future preference and<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          2) infinitely expandable material demand.<br>
          <br>
          In a sense, these are contradictory since the former implies
          that<br>
          Western economic man will make almost any sacrifice in the
          present for<br>
          the same of some hypothetical benefit in the future while the
          latter<br>
          implies almost insatiable demand in the present. Nonetheless,
          both are<br>
          essential features of the overwhelming Western economic
          system.<br>
          Future preference came out of the Christian outlook and<br>
          especially the Puritan tradition which was prepared to accept
          almost<br>
          any kind of sacrifice in the temporal world for the sake of
          future<br>
          eternal salvation, willing to restrict their enjoyment of
          income for<br>
          the sake of capital accumulation.<br>
          <br>
          The mass production of this new industrial system was able to<br>
          continue and to accelerate to the fantastic rate of the 20th
          century<br>
          so that today, the average middle-class family of suburbia has
          a<br>
          schedule of future material demands which is limitless.<br>
          Without these two psychological assumptions, the Western
          economy<br>
          would break down or would never have started. At present,
          future<br>
          preference may be breaking down and infinitely expanding
          material<br>
          demand may soon follow it in the weakening process. If so, the<br>
          American economy will collapse unless it finds new
          psychological<br>
          foundations.<br>

          In Asia, as is traditional along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis,
          the<br>
          structure of societies had been one in which a coalition of
          army,<br>
          bureaucracy, landlords, and moneylenders have exploited a
          great mass<br>
          of peasants by extortion of taxes, rents, low wages, and high
          interest<br>
          rates in a system of such persistence that its basic structure
          goes<br>
          back to the Bronze Age empires before 1000 B.C.<br>

          Weapons will continue to be expensive and complex. This means<br>
          that they will increasingly be the tools of professionalized,
          if not<br>
          mercenary, forces. All of past history shows that the shift
          from a<br>
          mass army of citizen-soldiers to a smaller army of
          professional<br>
          fighters leads, in the long run, to a decline of democracy.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1204<br>
          <br>
          When Khrushchev renounced the use of both nuclear war and<br>
          conventional violence, and promised to defeat the West by
          peaceful<br>
          competition, he was convinced that the Soviet Union could
          out-perform<br>
          the U.S. because it could, in his opinion, overcome the
          American lead<br>
          in the race for economic development that the Socialist way of
          life<br>
          would become the model for emulation by the uncommitted
          nations.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1213<br>
          <br>
          In other economies, when additional demands are presented to
          the<br>
          economy, less resources are available for alternative uses.
          But in the<br>
          American system, as it now stands, additional new demands
          usually lead<br>
          to increased resources becoming available for alternative
          purposes,<br>
          notably consumption. Thus if the Soviet Union embraced a
          substantial<br>
          increase in space activity, the resources available for
          raising<br>
          Russian levels of consumption would be reduced while in
          America, any<br>
          increases in the space budget makes levels of consumption also
          rise.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1214<br>
          <br>
          It does this because increased space expenditures provide<br>
          purchasing power for consumption that makes available
          previously<br>
          unused resources out of the unused American productive
          capacity.<br>
          This unused capacity exists in the American economy because
          the<br>
          structure of our economic system is such that it channels
          flows of<br>
          funds into the production of additional capacity (investment)
          without<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          any conscious planning process or any real desire by anyone to<br>
          increase our productive capacity. It does this because certain<br>
          institutions in our system (such as insurance, retirement
          funds,social<br>
          security payments, undistributed corporate profits and such)
          and<br>
          certain individuals who personally profit by the flow of funds
          not<br>
          theirs into investment continue to operate to increase
          investment even<br>
          when they have no real desire to increase productive capacity
          (and<br>
          indeed many decry it). In the Soviet Union, on the contrary,
          resources<br>
          are allotted to the increase of productive capacity by a
          conscious<br>
          planning process and at the cost of reducing the resources
          available<br>
          in their system for consumption or for the government (largely<br>
          defence).<br>
          <br>
          Thus the meaning of "costs" and the limitations on ability to<br>
          mobilize economic resources are entirely different in our
          system from<br>
          the Soviet system and most others. In the Soviet economy,
          "costs" are<br>
          real costs, measurable in terms of the allotment of scarce
          resources<br>
          that could have been used otherwise. In the American system,
          "costs"<br>
          are fiscal or financial limitations that have little
          connection with<br>
          the use of scarce resources or even with the use of available
          (and<br>
          therefore not scarce) resources. The reason for this is that
          in the<br>
          American economy, the fiscal or financial limit is lower than
          the<br>
          limit established by real resources and therefore, since the
          financial<br>
          limits act as the restraint on our economic activities, we do
          not get<br>
          to the point where our activities encounter the restraints
          imposed by<br>
          the limits of real resources (except rarely and briefly in
          terms of<br>
          technically trained manpower, which is our most limited
          resource).<br>
          These differences between the Soviet and American economies
          are:<br>
          <br>
          1) the latter has built-in, involuntary, institutionalized
          investment<br>
          which the former lacks;<br>
          <br>
          2) the latter has fiscal restraints at a much lower level of
          economic<br>
          activity which the Soviet system also lacks.<br>
          <br>
          Thus greater activity in defence in the USSR entails real
          costs<br>
          since it puts pressure on the ceiling established by limited
          real<br>
          resources while greater activity in the American defence or
          space<br>
          effort releases money into the system which presses upward on
          the<br>
          artificial financial ceiling, pressing it upward closer to the
          higher,<br>
          and remote, ceiling established by the real resources limit of
          the<br>
          American economy. This makes available the unused productive
          capacity<br>
          that exists in our system between the financial ceiling and
          the real<br>
          resources ceiling; it not only makes these unused resources
          available<br>
          for the government sector of the economy from which the
          expenditure<br>
          was directly made but also makes available portions of these
          released<br>
          resources for consumption and additional capital investment.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1215<br>
          <br>
          For this reason, government expenditures in the U.S. for
          things<br>
          like defence or space may entail no real costs at all in terms
          of the<br>
          economy as a whole. In fact, if the volume of unused capacity
          brought<br>
          into use by expenditures for these things (that is, defence
          and so on)<br>
          is greater than the resources necessary to satisfy the need
          for which<br>
          the expenditure was made, the volume of unused resources made<br>
          available for consumption or investment will be greater than
          the<br>
          volume of resources used in the governmental expenditure and
          this<br>
          additional government effort will cost nothing at all in real
          terms,<br>
          but will entail "negative" real costs. (Our wealth will be
          increased<br>
          by making the effort).<br>
          <br>
          The basis for this strange, and virtually unique, situation is
          to<br>
          be found in the large amount of unused productive capacity in
          the U.S.<br>
          even in our most productive years. In the second quarter of
          1962, our<br>
          productive system was running at a very high level of
          prosperity, yet<br>
          it was functioning about 12% below capacity, which represented
          a loss<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          of $73 billion annually. In this way, in the whole period from
          the<br>
          beginning of 1953 to the middle of 1962, our productive system<br>
          operated at $387 billion below capacity. Thus if the system
          had<br>
          operated near capacity, our defence effort over the nine years
          would<br>
          have cost us nothing, in terms of loss of goods or capacity.<br>
          This unique character in the American economy rests on the
          fact<br>
          that the utilization of resources follows flow lines in the
          economy<br>
          that are not everywhere reflected by corresponding flow lines
          of<br>
          claims on wealth (that is, money). In general, in our economy
          the<br>
          lines of flow of claims on wealth are such that they provide a
          very<br>
          large volume of savings and a rather large volume of
          investment, even<br>
          when no one really wants new productive capacity; they also
          provide an<br>
          inadequate flow of consumer purchasing power, in terms of
          flows, or<br>
          potential flows, of consumer goods; but they provide very
          limited,<br>
          sharply scrutinized and often misdirected flows of funds for
          the use<br>
          of resources to fulfill the needs of the government sector of
          our<br>
          trisectored economy. As a result, we have our economy
          distorted<br>
          resource-utilization patterns, with overinvestment in many
          areas,<br>
          overstuffed consumers in one place and impoverished consumers
          in<br>
          another place, a drastic undersupply of social services, and<br>
          widespread social needs for which public funds are lacking.<br>
          In the Soviet Union, money flows follow fairly well the flows
          of<br>
          real goods and resources, but, as as result, pressures are
          directly on<br>
          resources. These pressures mean that saving and investment
          conflict<br>
          directly with consumption and government services (including
          defence),<br>
          putting the government under severe direct strains, as the
          demands for<br>
          higher standards of living cannot be satisfied except by
          curtailing<br>
          investment, defence, space, or other government expenditures.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1216<br>
          <br>
          Many countries of the world are worse off the Soviet Union<br>
          because their efforts to increase consumers' goods may well
          require<br>
          investment based on savings that must be accumulated at the
          expense of<br>
          consumption.<br>
          <br>
          As a chief consequence of these conditions, the contrast
          between<br>
          the "have" nations and the "have-not" nations will become even
          wider.<br>
          This would be of little great importance to the rest of the
          world were<br>
          it not that the peoples of the backward areas, riding the
          "crisis of<br>
          rising expectations" are increasingly unwilling to be ground
          down in<br>
          poverty as their predecessors were. At the same time, the
          Superpower<br>
          stalemate increases the abilities of these nations to be
          neutral, to<br>
          exercise influence out of all relationship to their actual
          powers, and<br>
          to act, sometimes, in an irresponsible fashion.<br>
          <br>
          These neutrals and other peoples of backward areas have acute<br>
          problems. Solutions do exist but the underdeveloped nations
          are<br>
          unlikely to find them.<br>

          <br>
          A growing lowest social class of the social outcasts (the<br>
          Lumpenproletariat) has reappeared. This group of rejects from
          the<br>
          bourgeois industrial society provide one of our most
          intractable<br>
          future problems because they are gathered in urban slums, have<br>
          political influence, and are socially dangerous.<br>
          In the U.S. where these people congregate in the largest
          cities<br>
          and are often Negroes or Latin Americans, they are regarded as
          a<br>
          racial or economic problem, but they are really an educational
          and<br>
          social problem for which economic or racial solutions would
          help<br>
          little. This group is most numerous in the more advanced
          industrial<br>
          areas and now forms more than 20% of the American population.
          Since<br>
          they are a self-perpetuating group and have many children,
          they are<br>
          increasing in numbers faster than the rest of the population.<br>

          The pattern of outlook on which the tradition of the West is<br>
          based has six parts:<br>
          <br>
          1) There is truth, a reality (thus the West rejects
          skepticism,<br>
          solipsism and nihilism)<br>
          <br>
          2) No person, group, or organization has the whole picture of
          the<br>
          truth (thus there is no absolute or final authority.)<br>
          <br>
          3) Every person of goodwill has some aspect of the truth, some
          vision<br>
          of it from the angle of his own experience.<br>
          <br>
          4) Through discussion, the aspects of the truth held by many
          can be<br>
          pooled and arranged to form a consensus closer to the truth
          than any<br>
          of the sources that contributed to it.<br>
          <br>
          5) This consensus is a temporary approximation of the truth
          which new<br>
          experiences make it necessary to reformulate.<br>
          <br>
          6) Thus Western man's picture of the truth advances closer and
          closer<br>
          to the whole truth without ever reaching it.<br>
          <br>
          This methodology of the West is basic to the success, power
          and<br>
          wealth of Western Civilization.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          To the West, in spite of all its aberrations, the greatest sin<br>
          from Lucifer to Hitler, has been pride, especially in the form
          of<br>
          intellectual arrogance, and the greatest virtue has been
          humility,<br>
          especially in the intellectual form which concedes that
          opinions are<br>
          always subject to modification by new experiences, new
          evidence, and<br>
          the opinions of our fellow men.<br>
          <br>
          The most triumphant of these aspects is science, whose method
          is<br>
          a perfect example of the Western tradition. The scientist goes
          eagerly<br>
          to work each day because he has the humility to know that he
          does not<br>
          have any final answers and must work to modify and improve the
          answers<br>
          he has. He publishes his opinions and research reports or
          exposes<br>
          these in scientific gatherings so that they may be subjected
          to the<br>
          criticism of his colleagues and thus gradually play a role in<br>
          formulating the constantly unfolding consensus that is
          science. That<br>
          is what science is, "a consensus unfolding in time by a
          cooperative<br>
          effort in which each works diligently seeking the truth and
          submits<br>
          his work to the discussion and critique of his fellows to make
          a new,<br>
          slightly improved, temporary consensus."<br>

          THE UNITED STATES AND THE MIDDLE-CLASS CRISIS<br>
          <br>
          Page 1234<br>
          <br>
          American society in the 1920s was largely middle-class. Its<br>
          values and aspirations were middle-class and power or
          influence within<br>
          it was in the hands of middle-class people.<br>
          Most defenders of bourgeois America saw the country in
          middleclass<br>
          terms and looked forward to a not remote future in which<br>
          everyone would be middle-class except for a small shiftless
          minority<br>
          of no importance. America was regarded as a ladder of
          opportunity.<br>
          Wealth, power, prestige and respect were all obtained by the
          same<br>
          standard, based on money. This in turn was based on a
          pervasive<br>
          emotional insecurity that sought relief in the ownership and
          control<br>
          of material possessions.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1235<br>
          <br>
          Years ago in Europe, the risks (and rewards) of commercial<br>
          enterprise, well reflected in the fluctuating fortunes of
          figures such<br>
          as Antonio in The Merchant of Venice were extreme. A single
          venture<br>
          could ruin a merchant or make him rich. This insecurity was
          increased<br>
          by the fact that the prevalent religion of the day disapproved
          of what<br>
          he was doing, seeking profits or taking interest, and he could
          see no<br>
          way of providing religious services to the town dwellers
          because of<br>
          the intimate association of the ecclesiastical system with the<br>
          existing arrangement of rural landholding.<br>

          Credit became more important than intrinsic personal
          qualities,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; (123 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          and credit was based on the appearance of things, especially
          the<br>
          appearances of the external material accessories of life. Old
          values<br>
          such as future preference or self-discipline, remained, but
          were<br>
          redirected. Future preference ceased to be transcendental in
          its aim<br>
          and became secularized.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1237<br>
          <br>
          Middle-class self-discipline and future preference provided
          the<br>
          savings and investment without which any innovation - no
          matter how<br>
          appealing in theory - would be set aside and neglected.<br>
          The middle-class character is psychic insecurity founded on
          lack<br>
          of secure social status. The cure for such insecurity became<br>
          insatiable material acquisition. From this flowed attributes
          of future<br>
          preference, self-discipline, social conformity, infinitely
          expandable<br>
          material demand, and a general emphasis on externalized
          impersonal<br>
          values. The urge to seek truth or to help others are not
          really<br>
          compatible with the middle-class values.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1238<br>
          <br>
          One of the chief changes, fundamental to the survival of the<br>
          middle-class outlook, was a change in society's basic
          conception of<br>
          human nature. This had two parts to it. The traditional
          Christian<br>
          attitude was that human nature was essentially good and that
          it was<br>
          formed and modified by social pressures and training. The
          "goodness"<br>
          of human nature was based on the belief that it was a kind of
          weaker<br>
          copy of God's nature. In this Western point of view, evil and
          sin were<br>
          negative qualities; they arose from an absence of good, not
          from the<br>
          presence of evil. Thus sin was the failure to do the right
          thing, not<br>
          doing the wrong thing.<br>
          <br>
          Opposed to this view was another which received its most
          explicit<br>
          formulation by the Persian Zoroaster in the seventh century
          B.C. It<br>
          came in through the Persian influence on the Hebrews,
          especially<br>
          during the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, in the sixth
          century and<br>
          more fully through the Greek rationalist tradition from
          Pythagoras to<br>
          Plato. The general distinction of this point of view from
          Zoroaster to<br>
          William Golding (in Lord of the Flies) is that the world and
          the flesh<br>
          are positive evils and that man, in at least this physical
          part of his<br>
          nature, is essentially evil. As a consequence, he must be
          disciplined<br>
          totally to prevent him from destroying himself and the world.
          In this<br>
          view, the devil is a force, or being, of positive malevolence
          and man,<br>
          by himself, is incapable of good and is, accordingly, not
          free. He can<br>
          be saved in eternity by God's grace alone and he can get
          through this<br>
          temporal world only by being subjected to a regime of total
          despotism.<br>
          <br>
          The contrasts can be summed up thus:<br>
          <br>
          Orthodox;<br>
          Puritan.<br>
          Evil is an absence of Good;<br>
          Evil is a positive entity.<br>
          Man is basically good;<br>
          Man is basically evil.<br>
          Man is free;<br>
          Man is a slave of his nature.<br>
          Man can contribute to his salvation by good works;<br>
          Man can be saved only by God.<br>
          Self-discipline is necessary to guide or direct;<br>
          Discipline must be external and total.<br>
          Truth found from experience and revelation interpreted by
          tradition;<br>
          Truth is found by rational deduction from revelation.<br>
          <br>
          Luther, Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Blaise Pascal and others
          believed<br>
          that truth was to be found in rational deduction from a few
          basic<br>
          revealed truths in sharp contrast with the orthodox point of
          view<br>
          still represented by the Anglican and Roman churches which saw
          men as<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; (124 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          largely free in a universe whose rules were to be found by
          tradition<br>
          and consensus.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1240<br>
          <br>
          The Puritan point of view led directly to mercantilism which<br>
          regarded political-economic life as a struggle to the death in
          a world<br>
          where there not sufficient wealth or space for different
          groups. To<br>
          them, wealth was limited to a fixed amount and one man's gain
          was<br>
          someone else's loss. That meant that the basic struggles of
          this world<br>
          were irreconcilable and must be fought to a finish. This as
          part of<br>
          the Puritan belief that nature was evil and that a state of
          nature was<br>
          a jungle of violent conflicts.<br>
          <br>
          One large change was the Community of Interests which rejected<br>
          mercantilism's insistence on limited wealth and the basic<br>
          incompatibility of interests for the more optimistic belief
          that all<br>
          parties could somehow adjust their interests within a
          community in<br>
          which all would benefit mutually.<br>
          <br>
          Above all, the middle-class which dominated the country in the<br>
          first half of the 20th century were a small group of
          aristocrats.<br>
          Below were the petty bourgeoisie who had middle-class
          aspirations.<br>
          Below these two were two lower classes: the workers and the<br>
          Lumpenproletariat.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1242<br>
          <br>
          In America, as elsewhere, aristocracy represents money and<br>
          position grown old, and is organized in terms of families
          rather than<br>
          of individuals. Traditionally it was made up of those families
          who had<br>
          money, position,and social prestige for so long that they
          never had to<br>
          think about these and,above all, never had to impress any
          other person<br>
          with the fact that they had them. They accepted these
          attributes of<br>
          family membership as a right and an obligation. Since they had
          no idea<br>
          that these could be lost, they were self-assured, natural but
          distant.<br>
          Their manners were gracious but impersonal. Their chief
          characteristic<br>
          was the assumption that their family position had obligations.
          This<br>
          "noblesse oblige" led them to participate in school sports
          (even if<br>
          they lacked obvious talent) to serve their university (usually
          a<br>
          family tradition) in any helpful way, and to offer their
          services to<br>
          their local community, their state, and their country as an<br>
          obligation.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1243<br>
          <br>
          Another good evidence of class may be seen in the treatment
          given<br>
          to servants who work in one's home: the lower classes treat
          these as<br>
          equals, the middle-classes treat them as inferiors, while the<br>
          aristocrats treat them as equals or even superiors. On the
          whole, the<br>
          number of aristocratic families in the U.S. is very few, with
          a couple<br>
          in each of the older states. A somewhat larger group of
          semiaristocrats<br>
          consists of those like the Lodges, Rockefellers, or<br>
          Kennedys,who are not yet completely aristocratic either
          because they<br>
          are not, in generations, far enough removed from money-making,
          or<br>
          because of the persistence of a commercial or business
          tradition in<br>
          the family.<br>
          <br>
          The second most numerous group in the U.S. is the petty<br>
          bourgeoisie, including millions of persons who regard
          themselves as<br>
          middle-class and are under all the middle-class anxieties and<br>
          pressures but often earn less money than unionized laborers.
          As a<br>
          result of these things, they are often very insecure, envious,
          filled<br>
          with hatreds, and are generally the chief recruits for any
          Radical<br>
          Right, Fascist, or hate campaigns against any group that is
          different<br>
          or which refuses to conform to middle-class values. Made up of
          clerks,<br>
          shopkeepers, and vast numbers of office workers in business,<br>
          government, finance and education, these tend to regard their
          white<br>
          collar status as the chief value in life, and live in an
          atmosphere of<br>
          envy, pettiness, insecurity, and frustration. They form the
          major<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; (125 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          portion of the Republican Party's supporters in the towns of
          America,<br>
          as they did for the Nazis in Germany thirty years ago.<br>

          <br>
          Eisenhower himself was repelled by the Radical Right whose<br>
          impetus had been a chief element in his election although the
          lowermiddle-<br>
          class had preferred Senator Taft as their leader. Eisenhower<br>
          however had been preferred by the Eastern Establishment of old
          Wall<br>
          Street, Ivy League, semi-aristocratic Anglophiles whose real
          strength<br>
          rested in their control of eastern financial endowments
          operating from<br>
          foundations, academic halls, and other tax-exempt refuges.<br>
          As we have said, this Eastern Establishment was really above<br>
          parties. They had been the dominant element in both parties
          since 1900<br>
          and practiced the political techniques of J.P. Morgan.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1245<br>
          <br>
          They were, as we have said, Anglophile, cosmopolitan, Ivy
          League,<br>
          internationalist, astonishingly liberal, patrons of the arts,
          and<br>
          relatively humanitarian. All these things made them anathema
          to the<br>
          lower-middle-class and petty-bourgeois groups who supplied the
          votes<br>
          in Republican electoral victories but found it so difficult to
          control<br>
          nominations (especially in presidential elections) because the
          big<br>
          money necessary for nominating in a Republican convention was
          allied<br>
          to Wall Street and to the Eastern Establishment. The ability
          of the<br>
          latter to nominate Eisenhower over Taft in 1952 was a bitter
          pill to<br>
          the radical bourgeoisie.<br>
          <br>
          Kennedy was an Establishment figure. His introduction to the<br>
          Establishment arose from his support in Britain. His
          acceptance into<br>
          the English Establishment opened its American branch as well.
          Another<br>
          indication of this connection was the large number of
          Oxford-trained<br>
          men appointed to office by President Kennedy.<br>
          <br>
          Page 1246<br>
          <br>
          In the minds of the ill-informed, the political struggle in
          the<br>
          U.S. has always been viewed as a struggle between Republicans
          and<br>
          Democrats at the ballot box in November. Wall Street long ago
          had seen<br>
          that the real struggle was in the nominating conventions. This<br>
          realization was forced upon the petty-bourgeois supporters of<br>
          Republican candidates by their inability to nominate their<br>
          congressional favorites. Just as they reached this conclusion,
          the new<br>
          wealth appeared in the political picture, sharing
          petty-bourgeois<br>
          suspicions of the East, big cities, Ivy League universities,<br>
          foreigners, intellectuals, workers and aristocrats. By the
          1964<br>
          election, the major political issue in the country was the
          financial<br>
          struggle behind the scenes between the old wealth, civilized
          and<br>
          cultured in foundations, and the new wealth, virile and
          uninformed,<br>
          arising from the flowing profits of government-dependent
          corporations<br>
          in the West and Southwest.<br>
          <br>
          At issue here was the whole future face of America, for the
          older<br>
          wealth stood for values and aims close to the Western
          traditions of<br>
          diversity, tolerance, human rights and values, freedom, and
          the rest<br>
          of it, while the newer wealth stood for the narrow and
          fear-racked<br>
          aims of petty-bourgeois insecurity and egocentricity. The
          nominal<br>
          issues between them, such as that between internationalism and<br>
          unilateral isolationism (which its supporters preferred to
          rename<br>
          "nationalism") were less fundamental than they seemed, for the
          real<br>
          issue was the control of the Federal government's tremendous
          power to<br>
          influence the future of America by spending of government
          funds. The<br>
          petty bourgeois and new wealth groups wanted to continue that
          spending<br>
          into the industrial-military complex, such as defence and
          space, while<br>
          the older wealth and non-bourgeois groups wanted to direct it
          toward<br>
          social diversity and social amelioration for the aged and the
          young,<br>
          for education, for social outcasts, and for protecting
          national<br>

          The outcome of this struggle, which still goes on, is one in<br>
          which civilized people can afford to be optimistic. For the
          newer<br>
          wealth is unbelievably ignorant and misinformed.<br>
          The National parties and their presidential candidates, with
          the<br>
          Eastern Establishment assiduously fostering the process behind
          the<br>
          scenes, moved closer together and nearly met in the center
          with almost<br>
          identical candidates and platforms although the process was
          concealed,<br>
          as much as possible, by the revival of obsolescent or
          meaningless war<br>
          cries and slogans.<br>

          The two parties should be almost identical so that the
          American<br>
          people can "throw the rascals out" at any election without
          leading to<br>
          any profound or extensive shifts in policy. The policies that
          are<br>
          vital and necessary for America are no longer subjects of
          significant<br>
          disagreement, but are disputable only in details of procedure,<br>
          priority, or method: we must remain strong, continue to
          function as a<br>
          great World power in cooperation with other Powers, avoid
          high-level<br>
          war, keep the economy moving, help other countries do the
          same,<br>
          provide the basic social necessities for all our citizens,
          open up<br>
          opportunities for social shifts for those willing to work to
          achieve<br>
          them, and defend the basic Western outlook of diversity,
          pluralism,<br>
          cooperation,and the rest of it, as already described.<br>
          Either party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired,<br>
          unenterprising and vigorless. Then it should be possible to
          replace it<br>
          every four years by the other party which will be none of
          these things<br>
          but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same
          basic<br>
          policies.<br>

          The capture of the Republican National Party by the extremist<br>
          elements of the Republican National Party in 1964 and their
          effort to<br>
          elect Barry Goldwater with the petty-bourgeois extremists
          alone, was<br>
          only a temporary aberration on the American political scene
          and arose<br>
          from the fact that President Johnson had pre-empted all the
          issues so<br>
          that it was hardly worthwhile for the Republicans to run a
          real<br>
          contestant against him. Thus Goldwater was able to take
          control of the<br>
          party by default.<br>
          <br>
          The virulence behind the Goldwater campaign, however, had
          nothing<br>
          to do with default or lack of intensity. Quite the contrary.
          His most<br>
          ardent supporters were of the extremist petty-bourgeois
          mentality<br>
          driven to near hysteria by the disintegration of the
          middle-class and<br>
          the steady rise to prominence of everything they considered
          anathema:<br>
          Catholics, Negroes, immigrants, intellectuals, aristocrats,<br>
          scientists, and educated men generally, cosmopolitans and<br>
          internationalists and, above all, liberals who accept
          diversity ad a<br>
          virtue.<br>
          <br>
          This disintegration of the middle classes had a variety of<br>
          causes, some of them intrinsic, many of them accidental, a few
          of them<br>
          obvious, but many of them going deeply into the very depths of
          social<br>
          existence. All these causes acted to destroy the middle-class
          by<br>
          acting to destroy the middle-class outlook.<br>

          In the earlier period, even down to 1940, literature's attack
          on<br>
          the middle-class outlook was direct and brutal, from such
          works as<br>
          Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" or Frank Norris's "The Pit,"
          both<br>
          dealing with the total corruption of of personal integrity in
          the<br>
          meatpacking and wheat markets. These early assaults were aimed
          at the<br>
          commercialization of life under bourgeois influence and were<br>
          fundamentally reformist in outlook because they assumed that
          the evils<br>
          of the system could somehow be removed. By the 1920s, the
          attack was<br>
          much more total and saw the problem in moral terms so
          fundamental that<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; (127 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          no remedial action was possible. Only complete rejection of
          middleclass<br>
          values could remove the corruption of human life seen by<br>
          Sinclair Lewis in Babbitt or Main Street.<br>

          The Puritan point of view of man as a creature of total
          depravity<br>
          without hope of redemption which in the period 1550-1650
          justified<br>
          despotism in a Puritan context, now may be used, with
          petty-bourgeois<br>
          support, to justify a new despotism to preserve, by force
          instead of<br>
          conviction, petty-bourgeois values in a system of compulsory<br>
          conformity. George Orwell's 1984 has given us the picture of
          this<br>
          system as Hitler's Germany showed us its practical operation.
          Barry<br>
          Goldwater's defeat moved the possibility so far into the
          future that<br>
          the steady change in social conditions makes it remote indeed.<br>

          For generations, even in fairly rich families, the
          indoctrination<br>
          continued because of emphasis on thrift and restraints on
          consumption.<br>
          By 1937, the world depression showed that the basic economic
          problems<br>
          were not saving and investment but distribution and
          consumption. Thus<br>
          there appeared a growing readiness to consume, spurred on my
          new sales<br>
          techniques, installment selling and the extension of credit
          from the<br>
          productive side to the consumption side of the economic
          process. As a<br>
          result, an entirely new phenomenon appeared in middle-class
          families,<br>
          the practice of living up to, or even beyond, their incomes -
          an<br>
          unthinkable scandal in any 19th century bourgeois family.<br>

          Middle-class marriages were usually based on middle-class
          values<br>
          of economic security and material status rather than on love.
          More<br>
          accurately, middle-class marriages were based on these
          material<br>
          considerations in fact, while everyone concerned pretended
          that they<br>
          were based on Romantic love. Even when the marriage becomes a
          success,<br>
          in the sense that it persists, it is never total and merely
          means that<br>
          the marriage becomes an enslaving relationship to the husbands
          and a<br>
          source of disappointment and frustration to the wives.<br>

          In the old days, the merchant bankers of London controlled
          fairly<br>
          well the funds that were needed for almost any enterprise to
          become a<br>
          substantial success. Today, much larger funds are available
          from many<br>
          diverse sources, from abroad, from government sources, from
          insurance<br>
          and pension funds, from profits from other enterprises. These
          are no<br>
          longer held under closely associated controls and are much
          more<br>
          impersonal and professional in their disposal so that on the
          whole, an<br>
          energetic man (or a group with a good idea) can get access to
          larger<br>
          funds today, and can do so without anyone much caring if he
          accepts<br>
          the established social precedents.<br>

          Tragedy and Hope? The tragedy of the period covered by this
          book<br>
          is obvious but the hope may seem dubious to many. Only the
          passage of<br>
          time will show if the hope I seem to see in the future is
          actually<br>
          there or is the result of mis-observation and self-deception.<br>
          The historian has difficulty distinguishing the features of
          the<br>
          present and generally prefers to restrict his studies to the<br>
          past,where the evidence is more freely available and where
          perspective<br>
          helps him to interpret the evidence. Thus the historian speaks
          with<br>
          decreasing assurance about the nature and significance of
          events as<br>
          they approach his own day. The time covered by this book seems
          to this<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;(128 of 129) <br>
          <br>
          historian to fall into three periods: the 19th century from
          1814 to<br>
          1895; the 20th century after World War II, and a long period
          of<br>
          transition from 1895 to 1950.<br>
          <br>
          The 20th century is utterly different from the 19th century
          and<br>
          the age of transition between the two was one of the most
          awful<br>
          periods in all human history. Two terrible wars sandwiching a
          world<br>
          economic depression revealed man's real inability to control
          his life<br>
          by nineteenth century techniques of laissez-faire,
          materialism,<br>
          competition, selfishness, nationalism, violence, and
          imperialism.<br>
          These characteristics of late nineteenth-century life
          culminated in<br>
          World War II in which more than 50 million persons were
          killed, most<br>
          of them by horrible deaths.<br>
          <br>
          The hope of the twentieth century rests on the recognition
          that<br>
          war and depression are man-made, and needless. They can be
          avoided in<br>
          the future by turning from the 19th century characteristics
          just<br>
          mentioned and going back to other characteristics that our
          Western<br>
          society has always regarded as virtues: generosity,
          compassion,<br>
          cooperation, rationality, and foresight, and finding an
          increased role<br>
          in human life for love, spirituality, charity, and
          self-discipline.<br>
          On the whole, we do know now that we can avoid continuing the<br>
          horrors of 1914-1945 and on that basis alone we maybe
          optimistic over<br>
          our ability to go back to the tradition of our Western society
          and to<br>
          resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive
          Diversity.<br>
